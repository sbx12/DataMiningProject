Data: 
	Earlier this week, Facebook announced a grand reshuffle of its leadership. First reported by Recode, the new structure includes 
teams for the companyâ€™s apps, new platforms and infrastructure, and central product services. Most of the people moving into new 
roles have been with the company for close to a decade or longer, and many have proven themselves adept at 
the skill Facebook appears to value over all others: growth.Chris Cox Is the New Mark ZuckerbergIf there were ever a 
question as to who would step in to fill Zuckerbergâ€™s shoes should something happen to him, it has been resolved. 
With his new role as head of the companyâ€™s family of appsâ€”Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and the tried and true Big 
Blue (aka Facebook)â€”Facebookâ€™s chief product officer is stepping out as the leader he has long been internally. Anyone paying close 
attention knows this already.Cox, who is very close friends with Zuckerberg, dropped out of a Stanford graduate program to join 
Facebook in 2005. Heâ€™s done a lot of jobs since. When I first met him in 2008, he was the 
25-year-old head of resources who zipped around the office on a ripstik. An engineer by training, he helped invent news 
feed and was the star of the video Facebook showed investors in the run-up to its initial public offering. Cox 
is a brilliant public face for the company because he pairs engineering rigor and Facebook history with an emotive voice 
that Zuckerberg sometimes lacks. (Check out his F8 keynote from 2011 to see this in action.)Coxâ€™s new role also suggests 
Facebook will integrate Instagram and WhatsApp more deeply into the company, now that theyâ€™re organizationally closer to Messenger and Facebook. 
This may have contributed to WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koumâ€™s departure last month.Javier Olivan Just Got a Lot More ImportantOf Zuckerbergâ€™s 
three direct reports on the product side of the business, Olivan is the only one not currently on Facebookâ€™s leadership 
page. The Spanish native arrived at Facebook after finishing his Stanford MBA in 2007 to run international growth, when the 
company had just 40 million users, most in the United States. The growth team is Facebookâ€™s Navy SEALs, a special-operations 
force brought in when the company sees potential for a feature to take off and the stakes are high. Historically, 
most teams at Facebook have included one of Olivanâ€™s direct reports.Olivanâ€™s responsibilities now include ad products, analytics, and a group 
called â€œintegrity, growth, and product management.â€? One could also read this as one way Zuckerberg is demoting ad products. Mark 
Rabkin, who is in charge, now reports to Olivan.Controversy Wont Stop WhatsAppâ€™s New BossUnlike its Instagram acquisition, Facebookâ€™s acquisition of 
WhatsApp was never a great culture fit. Koum promised to keep WhatsApp ad-free, then sold it to an ad company. 
In March, cofounder Brian Acton, whoâ€™d already left Facebook to start a foundation, advised his 35,000 Twitter followers to #Deletefacebook. 
Then last month, Koum announced he was leaving his post as WhatsAppâ€™s CEO and stepping off Facebookâ€™s board.Now Chris Daniels, 
a seven-year Facebook veteran, steps in to replace Koum, eschewing the title as CEO of WhatsApp for a vice president 
title. It will be on Daniels, who will report to Cox, to sort out a business for the messaging service. 
Heâ€™s got the experience to take on the challenge. Until recently, Daniels ran Facebookâ€™s internet.org initiatives around expanding access in 
developing countries. The largest of these projects is Free Basics, an app that offers access to free web services. Although 
telecom companies rejected the idea of partnering with Facebook to provide the Free Basics app early onâ€”and India banned it 
in 2016â€”more than 80 carriers partner with Facebook to offer the service.Facebook Probably Has a Blockchain PlanDavid Marcus, who ran 
Facebookâ€™s Messenger app, will now lead a team of fewer than a dozen people dedicated to blockchain technology. Kevin Weil, 
who was in charge of product at Instagram, is joining him along with James Everingham, who was in charge of 
engineering there. (WIREDâ€™s Erin Griffith and Sandra Upson have some thoughts on what this means.)A board member of cryptocurrency wallet 
Coinbase with a lot of payments experience, Marcus has a history of leaving large posts to take up seemingly small 
projects. He was CEO of PayPal in 2014 when he left to run Messenger. The move was a head-scratcher: At 
the time, Messenger was a tiny messaging app that had failed to take off as an email replacement. But Zuckerberg 
had a plan to transform Messenger into a better version of WhatsApp (which, it should be said, heâ€™d just bought), 
one that businesses could harness to reach users in new ways.Messengerâ€™s Chief is a Growth ExpertReplacing Marcus at Messenger is 
Stan Chudnovsky. Heâ€™s one of the newer members of the leadership bench, having arrived at Facebook in 2014. Like Marcus, 
Chudnovsky is a serial entrepreneur; he sold his last company, the software startup IronPearl, to PayPal before it was a 
year old. Chudnovskyâ€™s nascent startup had been building growth tools for companies, and at PayPal he was head of growth. 
At Messenger, Chudnovsky worked closely with Marcus to grow Messenger into a service with more than 1.3 billion monthly active 
users.There Are Almost No Women HereA shamefully obvious aspect of the image of the org chart that Recode pieced together 
earlier this week is the paucity of female faces. In fact, thereâ€™s only one: Naomi Gleit, who now runs â€œintegrity, 
growth and product management.â€? Gleit, who is Facebookâ€™s longest tenured employee (she was #29), has long been part of the 
growth team at Facebook and was until recently the companyâ€™s â€œvice president of social good.â€? Gleit is a force to 
be reckoned with, no doubt. But this new structure raises questions about Zuckerbergâ€™s commitment to building an inclusive workforce. For 
as much as the company has benefitted from the work its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has done personally to 
promote women, it should be unacceptable for Zuckerberg to fill 13 of the companyâ€™s 14 most critical technical positions with 
men.A New Face(book)What the deal with Facebook and the blockchain?House Democrats recently released 3,500 Russia-linked Facebook ads.Here what Facebook wont
