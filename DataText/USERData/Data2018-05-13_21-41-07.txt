Data: 
	This week, the United States officially backed out of the Iran nuclear deal. The geopolitical reverberations should continue to 
play out in a variety of fields, but make sure you count cybersecurity among them. Iran targeted the US frequentlyâ€”particularly 
financial institutions before the deal went into place. Security experts warn that with the agreement no longer in place, the 
barrage could begin again. So, look out for that!We also took a look at facial recognition technology. Law enforcement around 
the world uses it more than ever, but picking out a single face out of a crowd of 60,000 feels 
downright dystopianâ€”as does wrongly identifying several thousand people as potential criminals. It off-putting at either extreme, which seems like a 
decent argument to slow down its deployment.Microsoft, meanwhile, has introduced JavaScript to Excel, which makes security researchers as anxious as 
it delights hackers and phishers. Speaking of which, your Facebook and Twitter accounts are vulnerable. Here how to lock them 
down once and for all.And this isnt security, specifically, but if, hypothetically, Donald Trump had bought up so many properties 
in cash as part of an elaborate money laundering scheme? Here how that would work.And there more! As always, weâ€™ve 
rounded up all the news we didnâ€™t break or cover in depth this week. Click on the headlines to read 
the full stories. And stay safe out there.Researchers Send Secret Commands to Voice AssistantsYou know how dogs can hear noises 
you cant? Guess what! So can Alexa and Google Assistant and Siri. And while research along those lines has been 
fomenting for the last several years, a team from UC-Berkeley this month demonstrated that they can hide voice-assistant commands not 
just in white noise, but behind actual voices or music. It not a hack that appears to have hit the 
wild yet, but there every reason to expect that it will eventually. And given the amount that we offload to 
voice assistantsâ€”purchases, door locks, and moreâ€”that could have serious consequences.Signal Disappearing Messages Dont Always Disappear on MacsSignal remains our pick 
for the best encrypted messaging service. But those who use its desktop client with the default settings may have inadvertently 
stored those messages indefinitely on their Mac notification bar, even if they had been set to self-destruct. Not ideal! On 
Thursday, Signal pushed an update that should fix the issue, but just to be safe, any desktop Signal users should 
do what they can to triple check that messages they thought were gone forever really are.The Ring Video Doorbell Had 
a Major Security OversightOn the one hand, a video doorbell helps you increase your personal security, keeping close tabs on 
who coming and who going. On the other hand, yikes! Popular model Ring, recently acquired by Amazon, until recently wouldnt 
log users out of its app after the password changed. That meant that if you switched up your authentication to, 
say, deny access to an ex, they could still essentially spy on your front door. (In fact, that precisely what 
happened in an incident outlined by The Information.) Ring says it updated the app in January such that everyone has 
to log back in now after a password reset, but even now it doesnt take effect for several hours.A Service 
Can Track Nearly Any Cell Phone in the USAs if Facebook didnt give you enough surveillance hassles lately, The New 
York Times takes a look at a company called Securus, which advertises the ability to track nearly any cell phone 
in the US within seconds. Theyre able to do so because carriers regularly sell access to location services to third 
parties with no customer consent and little oversight. Meanwhile, not every state even requires a warrant to gather location data, 
which all adds up to a pretty nightmarish scenario of being snooped on without any knowledgeâ€”or any way to prevent 
it. Related VideoSecurityHow to Control What Alexa and Google Assistant Do With Your Voice DataVirtual assistants like Google Home and 
Amazon Alexa can be amazing but what are they doing with all of your questions? Heres how to control all 
of that data.

Data: 
	Earlier this week, the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released roughly 3,500 Facebook and Instagram ads purchased by 
the Internet Research Agency, a notorious Russian troll farm. Among them: Ads purchased in May of 2016 that promoted a 
suspicious Chrome extension that gained wide access to the Facebook accounts and web browsing behavior of those who installed it.The 
ads, dozens in total, prompted users to install the extension, a music app called FaceMusic; when they did, some users 
reported that it began messaging all of their Facebook friends. The landing page for the ads, musicfb.info, was registered in 
April of 2016 in St. Petersburg, Russia, where the IRA is based.The most successful ad, which yielded 28 clicks, specifically 
targeted American girls, ages 14 to 17, who Facebook classified as interested in free software and music. Other ads for 
FaceMusic targeted interest categories like Shazam, Spotify, Apple Music, or Soundcloud.The ads containing the extension, purchased by the IRA phony 
anti-immigrant Facebook page Stop All Invaders, were discovered by Jonathan Albright, director of research at Columbia University Tow Center for 
Digital Journalism.Why would an anti-immigrant Russian Facebook Page be spending money to promote a music app? Albright says.HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT 
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYThe landing site that the ad directed to, musicfb.info, is no longer active, but an archived version 
advertises a â€œunique browser extension, which allows you to play your favorite music on Facebook for free and share it 
with your friends.â€?The extension is no longer active in the Chrome Web Store, either, and a Google spokesperson confirmed the 
company had also removed it from users devices. When we discover malicious extensions, we remove them from the Chrome Web 
Store and from every user computer that has downloaded them, the spokesperson said. We suspend the developer and remove their 
other extensions from the Store as well.Facebook could not confirm the number of people who signed into the extension through 
Facebook. It also unclear how many installed the extension after seeing the IRA Facebook ads. In total, the ads received 
just over 80 clicks, according to the metadata released by Facebook. Most of the ads received no clicks at all, 
likely because they had nothing to do with the other content posted by the Stop All Invaders page, which included, 
among other things, photoshopped memes calling President Obama a mere pawn in the hands of the Arabian Sheikhs.Facebook also wasnâ€™t 
the only platform where the IRA promoted FaceMusic. A Reddit user named Rubinjer, which Reddit has since identified as linked 
to the IRA, also posted it to the subreddit r/UsefulWebsites.Though the extension has been removed from the Chrome Web Store, 
JÃ©rÃ´me Segura, a researcher at the security firm Malwarebytes Labs, found an archived version of FaceMusic and installed it manually. 
He found that the extension asked users for permission to read and change all your data on the websites you 
visit, display notifications, and modify data you copy and paste.courtesy MalwarebytesIt also had permission to post to usersâ€™ Facebook timelines 
and message their friends. It apparently took full advantage. In June of 2016, a month after the IRAâ€™s ads went 
live, one user took to the online photo-sharing site Imgur to complain that FaceMusic had spammed their friends with Facebook 
messages. Facemusic sent a direct link to download their extension, to 100+ of my friends, the user wrote. PLEASE, DO 
NOT GET Facemusic!!! If you have it, GET RID OF IT IMMEDIATELY, change your FB password, and [perform] a virus 
scan. Several other users responded that the same had happened to them.Weâ€™ve seen examples of using a lure, like a 
music app or a game, for other purposes, says Segura. He notes, though, that the extension itself doesnt seem to 
contain malicious code, and received a clean bill of health from more than 50 antivirus engines. Instead, it used Facebook 
and Google generous permissions to access users data and message their friends.Segura says that these permissions, while broad, are fairly 
standard for Chrome extensions, which often overreach the boundaries of privacy. They have too many privileges. You download a game 
and all you want is the game, but the game wants contacts from your phone, he says. In the hands 
of a group like the IRA, that kind of unchecked power can go very wrong.Bad AdsThe 3,500 ads Congress released 
this week show just how Russia tried to influence US Facebook usersSpecial counsel Robert Mueller indictment of the IRA reads

Data: 
	Earlier this week, Facebook announced a grand reshuffle of its leadership. First reported by Recode, the new structure includes 
teams for the companyâ€™s apps, new platforms and infrastructure, and central product services. Most of the people moving into new 
roles have been with the company for close to a decade or longer, and many have proven themselves adept at 
the skill Facebook appears to value over all others: growth.Chris Cox Is the New Mark ZuckerbergIf there were ever a 
question as to who would step in to fill Zuckerbergâ€™s shoes should something happen to him, it has been resolved. 
With his new role as head of the companyâ€™s family of appsâ€”Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and the tried and true Big 
Blue (aka Facebook)â€”Facebookâ€™s chief product officer is stepping out as the leader he has long been internally. Anyone paying close 
attention knows this already.Cox, who is very close friends with Zuckerberg, dropped out of a Stanford graduate program to join 
Facebook in 2005. Heâ€™s done a lot of jobs since. When I first met him in 2008, he was the 
25-year-old head of resources who zipped around the office on a ripstik. An engineer by training, he helped invent news 
feed and was the star of the video Facebook showed investors in the run-up to its initial public offering. Cox 
is a brilliant public face for the company because he pairs engineering rigor and Facebook history with an emotive voice 
that Zuckerberg sometimes lacks. (Check out his F8 keynote from 2011 to see this in action.)Coxâ€™s new role also suggests 
Facebook will integrate Instagram and WhatsApp more deeply into the company, now that theyâ€™re organizationally closer to Messenger and Facebook. 
This may have contributed to WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koumâ€™s departure last month.Javier Olivan Just Got a Lot More ImportantOf Zuckerbergâ€™s 
three direct reports on the product side of the business, Olivan is the only one not currently on Facebookâ€™s leadership 
page. The Spanish native arrived at Facebook after finishing his Stanford MBA in 2007 to run international growth, when the 
company had just 40 million users, most in the United States. The growth team is Facebookâ€™s Navy SEALs, a special-operations 
force brought in when the company sees potential for a feature to take off and the stakes are high. Historically, 
most teams at Facebook have included one of Olivanâ€™s direct reports.Olivanâ€™s responsibilities now include ad products, analytics, and a group 
called â€œintegrity, growth, and product management.â€? One could also read this as one way Zuckerberg is demoting ad products. Mark 
Rabkin, who is in charge, now reports to Olivan.Controversy Wont Stop WhatsAppâ€™s New BossUnlike its Instagram acquisition, Facebookâ€™s acquisition of 
WhatsApp was never a great culture fit. Koum promised to keep WhatsApp ad-free, then sold it to an ad company. 
In March, cofounder Brian Acton, whoâ€™d already left Facebook to start a foundation, advised his 35,000 Twitter followers to #Deletefacebook. 
Then last month, Koum announced he was leaving his post as WhatsAppâ€™s CEO and stepping off Facebookâ€™s board.Now Chris Daniels, 
a seven-year Facebook veteran, steps in to replace Koum, eschewing the title as CEO of WhatsApp for a vice president 
title. It will be on Daniels, who will report to Cox, to sort out a business for the messaging service. 
Heâ€™s got the experience to take on the challenge. Until recently, Daniels ran Facebookâ€™s internet.org initiatives around expanding access in 
developing countries. The largest of these projects is Free Basics, an app that offers access to free web services. Although 
telecom companies rejected the idea of partnering with Facebook to provide the Free Basics app early onâ€”and India banned it 
in 2016â€”more than 80 carriers partner with Facebook to offer the service.Facebook Probably Has a Blockchain PlanDavid Marcus, who ran 
Facebookâ€™s Messenger app, will now lead a team of fewer than a dozen people dedicated to blockchain technology. Kevin Weil, 
who was in charge of product at Instagram, is joining him along with James Everingham, who was in charge of 
engineering there. (WIREDâ€™s Erin Griffith and Sandra Upson have some thoughts on what this means.)A board member of cryptocurrency wallet 
Coinbase with a lot of payments experience, Marcus has a history of leaving large posts to take up seemingly small 
projects. He was CEO of PayPal in 2014 when he left to run Messenger. The move was a head-scratcher: At 
the time, Messenger was a tiny messaging app that had failed to take off as an email replacement. But Zuckerberg 
had a plan to transform Messenger into a better version of WhatsApp (which, it should be said, heâ€™d just bought), 
one that businesses could harness to reach users in new ways.Messengerâ€™s Chief is a Growth ExpertReplacing Marcus at Messenger is 
Stan Chudnovsky. Heâ€™s one of the newer members of the leadership bench, having arrived at Facebook in 2014. Like Marcus, 
Chudnovsky is a serial entrepreneur; he sold his last company, the software startup IronPearl, to PayPal before it was a 
year old. Chudnovskyâ€™s nascent startup had been building growth tools for companies, and at PayPal he was head of growth. 
At Messenger, Chudnovsky worked closely with Marcus to grow Messenger into a service with more than 1.3 billion monthly active 
users.There Are Almost No Women HereA shamefully obvious aspect of the image of the org chart that Recode pieced together 
earlier this week is the paucity of female faces. In fact, thereâ€™s only one: Naomi Gleit, who now runs â€œintegrity, 
growth and product management.â€? Gleit, who is Facebookâ€™s longest tenured employee (she was #29), has long been part of the 
growth team at Facebook and was until recently the companyâ€™s â€œvice president of social good.â€? Gleit is a force to 
be reckoned with, no doubt. But this new structure raises questions about Zuckerbergâ€™s commitment to building an inclusive workforce. For 
as much as the company has benefitted from the work its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has done personally to 
promote women, it should be unacceptable for Zuckerberg to fill 13 of the companyâ€™s 14 most critical technical positions with 
men.A New Face(book)What the deal with Facebook and the blockchain?House Democrats recently released 3,500 Russia-linked Facebook ads.Here what Facebook wont 
let you post. Related VideoBusinessMark Zuckerberg House Testimony HighlightsHighlights from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergs appearance before the House Energy and

Data: 
	Lawmakers, child development experts, and privacy advocates are expressing concerns about two new Amazon products targeting children, questioning whether 
they prod kids to be too dependent on technology and potentially jeopardize their privacy.In a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff 
Bezos on Friday, two members of the bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus raised concerns about Amazonâ€™s smart speaker Echo Dot Kids 
and a companion service called FreeTime Unlimited that lets kids access a childrenâ€™s version of Alexa, Amazonâ€™s voice-controlled digital assistant.â€œWhile 
these types of artificial intelligence and voice recognition technology offer potentially new educational and entertainment opportunities, Americansâ€™ privacy, particularly childrenâ€™s 
privacy, must be paramount,â€? wrote Senator Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) and Representative Joe Barton (R-Texas), both cofounders of the privacy caucus.The 
letter includes a dozen questions, including requests for details about how audio of childrenâ€™s interactions is recorded and saved, parental 
control over deleting recordings, a list of third parties with access to the data, whether data will be used for 
marketing purposes, and Amazonâ€™s intentions on maintaining a profile on kids who use these products.In a statement, Amazon said it 
takes privacy and security seriously. The company said Echo Dot Kids Edition uses on-device software to detect the wake word 
and only the wake word. Only once the wake word is detected does it start streaming to the cloud, and 
it will present a visual indication (the light ring at the top of the device turns blue) to show that 
it is streaming to the cloud.Echo Dot Kids is the latest in a wave of products from dominant tech players 
targeting children, including Facebookâ€™s communications app Messenger Kids and Googleâ€™s YouTube Kids, both of which have been criticized by child 
health experts concerned about privacy and developmental issues.Like Amazon, toy manufacturers are also interested in developing smart speakers that would 
live in a childâ€™s room. In September, Mattel pulled Aristotle, a smart speaker and digital assistant aimed at children, after 
a similar letter from Markey and Barton, as well as a petition that garnered more than 15,000 signatures.One of the 
organizers of the petition, the nonprofit group Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, is now spearheading a similar effort against 
Amazon. In a press release Friday, timed to the letter from Congress, a group of child development and privacy advocates 
urged parents not to purchase Echo Dot Kids because the device and companion voice service pose a threat to childrenâ€™s 
privacy and well-being.â€œAmazon wants kids to be dependent on its data-gathering device from the moment they wake up until they 
go to bed at night,â€? said the groupâ€™s executive director Josh Golin. â€œThe Echo Dot Kids is another unnecessary â€˜must-haveâ€™ 
gadget, and itâ€™s also potentially harmful. AI devices raise a host of privacy concerns and interfere with the face-to-face interactions 
and self-driven play that children need to thrive.â€?FreeTime on Alexa includes content targeted at children, like kidsâ€™ books and Alexa 
skills from Disney, Nickelodeon, and National Geographic. It also features parental controls, such as song filtering, bedtime limits, disabled voice 
purchasing, and positive reinforcement for using the word â€œplease.â€?Despite such controls, the child health experts warning against Echo Dot Kids 
wrote, â€œUltimately, though, the device is designed to make kids dependent on Alexa for information and entertainment. Amazon even encourages 
kids to tell the device â€˜Alexa, Iâ€™m bored,â€™ to which Alexa will respond with branded games and content.â€?In Amazonâ€™s April 
press release announcing Echo Dot Kids, the company quoted one representative from a nonprofit group focused on children that supported 
the product, Stephen Balkam, founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute. Balkam referenced a report from his institute, 
which found that the majority of parents were comfortable with their child using a smart speaker. Although it was not 
noted in the press release, Amazon is a member of FOSI and has an executive on the board.In a statement 
to WIRED, Amazon said, We believe one of the core benefits of FreeTime and FreeTime Unlimited is that the services 
provide parents the tools they need to help manage the interactions between their child and Alexa as they see fit. 
Amazon said parents can review and listen to their childrenâ€™s voice recordings in the Alexa app, review FreeTime Unlimited activity 
via the Parent Dashboard, set bedtime limits or pause the device whenever theyâ€™d like.Balkam said his institute disclosed Amazon funding 
of its research on its website and the cover of its report. Amazon did not initiate the study. Balkam said 
the institute annually proposes a research project, and reaches out to its members, a group that also includes Facebook, Google, 
and Microsoft, who pay an annual stipend of $30,000. â€œAmazon stepped up and we worked with them. They gave us 
editorial control and we obviously gave them recognition for the financial support,â€? he said.Balkam says Echo Dot Kids addresses concerns 
from parents about excessive screen time. â€œItâ€™s screen-less, itâ€™s very interactive, itâ€™s kid friendly,â€? he said, pointing out Alexa skills 
that encourage kids to go outside.In its review of the product, BuzzFeed wrote, â€œUnless your parents purge it, your Alexa 
will hold on to every bit of data you have ever given it, all the way back to the first 
things you shouted at it as a 2-year-old.â€?Far From Sesame StreetFacebook funded most of the experts who vetted its Messenger 
Kids, an app for children as young as 6.Child-health advocates asked Facebook to discontinue Messenger Kids, claiming it will undermine 
childhood development.In a complaint to the FTC, child health and privacy groups allege that YouTube is violating a law that 
protects children online. Related VideoTechnologySeniors React to Amazon EchoWIRED asks a group of seniors what they think about Amazon Echo. 
Can they stump our new favorite digital assistant, Alexa?

Data: 
	If you click on the right-hand corner of any advertisement on Facebook, the social network will tell you why 
it was targeted to you. But what would happen if those buried targeting tactics were transparently displayed, right next to 
the ad itself? That the question at the heart of new research from Harvard Business School published in the Journal 
of Consumer Research. It turns out advertising transparency can be good for a platformâ€”but it depends on how creepy marketer 
methods are.The study has wide-reaching implications for advertising giants like Facebook and Google, which increasingly find themselves under pressure to 
disclose more about their targeting practices. The researchers found, for example, that consumers are reluctant to engage with ads that 
they know have been served based on their activity on third-party websites, a tactic Facebook and Google routinely use. Which 
also suggests that tech giants have a financial incentive to ensure users arent aware, at least up front, about how 
some ads are served.Dont Talk Behind My BackFor their study, Tami Kim, Kate Barasz and Leslie K. John conducted a 
number of online advertising experiments to understand the effect transparency has on user behavior. They found that if sites tell 
you theyre using unsavory tacticsâ€”like tracking you across the webâ€”youre far less likely to engage with their ads. The same 
goes for other invasive methods, like inferring something about your life when you havent explicitly provided that information. A famous 
example of this is from 2012, when Target began sending a woman baby-focused marketing mailers, inadvertently divulging to her father 
that she was pregnant.I think it will be interesting to see how firms respond in this age of increasing transparency, 
says John, a professor at Harvard Business School and one of the authors of the paper. Third-party data sharing obviously 
plays a big part in behaviorally targeted advertising. And behaviorally targeted advertising has been shown to be very effectiveâ€”in that 
it increases sales. But our research shows that when we become aware of third-party sharingâ€”and also of firms making inferences 
about usâ€”we feel intruded upon and as a result ad effectiveness can decline.The researchers didnt find, however, that users react 
poorly to all forms of ad transparency. If companies readily disclose that they employ targeting methods perceived to be acceptable, 
like recommending products based on items youve clicked in the past, people will make purchases all the same. And the 
study suggests that if people already trust the platform where those ads are displayed, they might even be more likely 
to click and buy.When we become aware of third-party sharingâ€”and also of firms making inferences about usâ€”we feel intruded upon.Leslie 
K. John, Harvard Business SchoolThe researchers say their findings mimic social truths in the real world. Tracking users across websites 
is viewed as an an inappropriate flow of information, like talking behind a friend back. Similarly, making inferences is often 
seen as unacceptable, even if youre drawing a conclusion the other person would freely disclose. For example, you might tell 
a friend that youre trying to lose weight, but find it inappropriate for him to ask if you want to 
shed some pounds. The same sort of rules apply to the online world, according to the study.And this brings to 
the topic that excites me the mostâ€”norms in the digital space are still evolving and less well understood, says Kim, 
the lead author of the study and a marketing professor at the University of Virginia business school. For marketers to 
build relationships with consumers effectively, itâ€™s critical for firms to understand what these norms are and avoid practices that violate 
these norms.Whered That Ad Come From?In one experiment, the researchers recruited 449 people from Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to look 
at ads for a fictional bookstore. They were randomly shown two different ad-transparency messages, one saying they were targeted based 
on products theyve clicked on in the past, and one saying they were targeted based on their activity on other 
websites. The study found that ads appended with the second messageâ€”revealing that users had been tracked across the webâ€”were 24 
percent less effective. (For the lab studies, effectiveness was based on how the subjects felt about the ads.)In another experiment, 
the researchers looked at whether ads are less effective when companies disclose theyre making inferences about their users. In this 
scenario, 348 participants were shown an ad for an art gallery, along with a message saying either they were seeing 
the ad based on your information that you stated about you, or based on your information that we inferred about 
you. In this study, ads were less 17 percent effective when it was revealed that they were targeted based on 
things a website concluded about you on its own, rather than facts you actively provided.The researchers found that their control 
ads, which didnt have any transparency messages, performed just as well as those with acceptable ad-transparency disclosuresâ€”implying that being up-front 
about targeting might not impact a company bottom line, as long as it not being creepy. The problem is that 
companies do sometimes use unsettling tactics; the Intercept discovered earlier this month, for example, that Facebook has developed a service 
designed to serve ads based on how it predicts consumers will behave in the future.In yet another experiment, the academics 
asked 462 participants to log into their Facebook accounts and look at the first ad they saw. They then were 
instructed to copy and paste Facebook Why am I seeing this ad message, as well as the name of the 
company that purchased it. Responses included standard targeting methods, like my age I stated on my profile, as well as 
invasive, distressing tactics like my sexual orientation that Facebook inferred based on my Facebook usage.Journal of Consumer ResearchThe researchers coded 
these responses, and gave them each a transparency score. The higher the score, the more acceptable the ad-targeting practice. The 
subjects were then asked how interested they were in the ad, including whether they would purchase something from the company 
website. The results show participants who were served ads using acceptable practices were more likely to engage than those who 
were served ads based on practices perceived to be unacceptable.Then, the researchers tested whether users who distrusted Facebook were less 
likely to engage with an ad; they found both that and the reverse to be true. People who trust Facebook 
more are more likely to engage with advertisementsâ€”though they have to be targeted in accepted ways. In other words, Facebook 
has a financial incentive beyond public relations to ensure users trust it. When they dont, people engage with advertisements less.Journal 
of Consumer ResearchWhat I think will be interesting moving forward is what users define for themselves as transparency. That definition 
is rapidly changing, and how platforms define it may not align with how users want or need it defined to 
feel like they understand, says Susan Wenograd, a digital advertising consultant with a Facebook focus. No one thought much of 
quizzes and apps being tied to Facebook before, but of course they do now since the testimony regarding Cambridge Analytica. 
It a fine line to be transparent without scaring users.When Transparency Works For EveryoneIn some situations, according to the study, 
being honest about targeting practices can even lead to more clicks and purchases. In another experiment, the researchers worked with 
two loyalty point-redemption programs, which previous research has shown consumers trust highly. When they showed people messages next to ads 
saying things like recommended based on your clicks on our site, they were more likely to click and make purchases 
than if no message was present.That says being honest can actually improve a company bottom lineâ€”as long as theyre not 
tracking and targeting users in an invasive way. As the researchers wrote, even the most personalized, perfectly targeted advertisement will 
flop if the consumer is more focused on the (un)acceptability of how the targeting was done in the first place.The

Data: 
	It will come as a surprise to many, particularly given its prominence in the never-ending Facebook news cycle, what 
a recent invention â€œprivacyâ€? is. The right to live as a stranger among strangers, with an inviolable sanctity of personal 
affairs against government or corporate intrusion, is a relatively new concept. The Oxford English Dictionary cites our current definition back 
to only 1814, and the first serious legal review of the conceptâ€”the now-classic The Right to Privacyâ€”was written by Louis 
Brandeis in 1890. Google Books, which has scanned and digitized a canon of books going back centuries, doesnâ€™t show much 
usage of the word until the 1960s.This relatively recent interest in, and legal defense of, privacy was a result of 
industrialization, rapidly growing cities, and the fraying of a local social fabric that once enmeshed (to not say ensnared) everyone 
within a set of expectations and possibilities. Privacy was and is a coping mechanism, a sanctuary from the increasingly anonymous 
and policed world to which modern man has migrated, and the technologies he confronted there. Brandeis cited the rise of 
newspapers and cheap photography as the motivating factors for his study, and the soon-to-be-enforced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from 
the European Union, aimed squarely at Google and Facebook, is another such reactive piece of jurisprudence.Antonio GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez (@antoniogm) is 
an Ideas contributor for WIRED. Before turning to writing, he dropped out of a doctoral program in physics to work 
on Goldman Sachsâ€™ credit trading desk, then joined the Silicon Valley startup world, where he founded his own startup (acquired 
by Twitter in 2011), and finally joined Facebookâ€™s early monetization team, where he headed its targeting efforts. His 2016 memoir, 
Chaos Monkeys, was a New York Times best seller and NPR Best Book of the Year, and his writing has 
appeared in Vanity Fair, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. He splits his time between a sailboat on the SF 
Bay and a yurt in Washingtonâ€™s San Juan Islands.However, in the hunter-gatherer tribes where humans evolved, or in the small 
towns where most Westerners lived until relatively recently, there was no notion of privacy. If you tried explaining privacy to 
a !Kung tribesman of the Kalahari Desert, or a late 18th-century French villager, theyâ€™d have no idea what you were 
talking about. Family sleeping arrangements were often communal and on a single bed until the Victorian Era, and generation after 
generation of families were born and buried alongside each other in ancestral townships that harbored few secrets. Meeting a stranger 
was likely a memorable event, and most pre-modern Westerners rarely interacted with anyone for whom they did not have a 
lengthy oral rap sheet.Iâ€™ve experienced whatâ€™s left of this communal life myself. In 2016, to write my memoir about building 
part of Facebookâ€™s monetization machine, I moved to a small, remote island in the Pacific Northwest, just shy of the 
Canadian border. After years adrift within the atomized, flaky world of San Francisco tech (where two people sitting 10 feet 
apart message each other via their smartphones), small-town life was a revelation. There, Facebook was completely unnecessary. Checking into a 
bar was automatic; the one you were at was the one open for business, and everyone who was not home 
was there.Â Every encounter involved a 10-minute recap of everything going on with your mutual friends, an impromptu, real-life news feed. 
What need was there for Facebook?Most notably, there was no privacy: Everyone knew who the drunk, the cheat, or the 
adulterer was. News flew almost as fast as Wi-Fi signals, and I met strangers whoâ€™d already gotten the download on 
who I was and what I was doing there (as one Facebook-stalks an online date).Deep down we hunger for that 
sense of community, and weâ€™ll find an outlet for it no matter what. If a platform can create the feeling 
of communityâ€”and Facebook is nothing if not an ersatz versionâ€”then the lack of privacy is fine, as it was on 
my island and throughout most of human history. Ultimately, nobody really cares about privacy, except media elites, under-employed Eurocrats, and 
zealots whoâ€™ve made it a career. Everyone else would sext you their privates for a fleeting feeling of human connection. 
And they do.(Donâ€™t agree with me? Think people really care about privacy? Hereâ€™s a pop quiz: When, during the past 
year, did Facebookâ€™s app have its highest ranking in the Google Play store? Answer: In late March, immediately after #deletefacebook 
went viral. People deleted their Facebook app in a fit of indignant furyâ€”and then re-installed it in droves, like a 
smoker quitting for a day and then buying a carton of smokes. Thereâ€™s now a privacy-industrial complex that strives relentlessly 
to keep itself relevant, but almost nobodyâ€™s behavior really changes.)As it turns out, Mark Zuckerberg mostly agrees with this Facebook-as-community 
metaphor, though heâ€™d express it more delicately. In February 2017, he published an unusual 6,000-word manifesto that, unlike most of 
his somewhat bland posts, is worth reading. There, he very immodestly proposes that Facebook occupy the social nexus vacated by 
the disappearance of churches, unions, lodges, and other local associations that once served as core of American civil life. This 
resurrected public forum would be as abstract and mobile as a Facebook group, and would no longer be restricted by 
the pesky limits of distance or national origin.This Facebook-as-community proxy is not without its problems, though, and itâ€™s where the 
smartphone version deviates from the real-world version that we encounter our modern pathologies. First, thereâ€™s the issue of overuse. Facebook 
is to real community as porn is to real sex: a cheap, digital knockoff for those who canâ€™t do better. 
Unfortunately, in both instances use of the simulacrum fries your brain in ways that prevent you from ever experiencing the 
real version again.Â But weâ€™ll take what we can get.The second major bug is geography. That slim piece of glass, metal, 
and silicon we keep in our pockets is like our own mobile Pacific Northwest island. Dunbarâ€™s number, the 150-or-so people 
that anthropologists have found most humans maintain as a social community, now lives in an easy-to-carry package.But that intangible network 
exists across space or even time, and therein lies the political problem. The fault lines of our new online polities 
run under and through the borders of the old, legacy ones. They donâ€™t respect the colored boxes on the map, 
boxes that used to refer to a common set of values, laws, and identities, but no longer do.Take the Blue 
State #resist voter as an example. That person is nominally a citizen of a continental nation-state that stretches â€œfrom sea 
to shining sea,â€? but more often sees herself as an inhabitant of an urban archipelago (and accompanying mediascape) stretching from 
Vancouver to Berlin. On the other side of our great divide, the Red State #MAGA voter from the Deep South 
has more in common with a UKIP-voting Brexiter in Leeds, or a Putin-supporting Russian nationalist, than with his metropolitan compatriots.This 
whole Facebook fracas is really the earthquake resulting from the realignment of these tribal tectonic plates underneath legacy states.Â Which is 
why so many citizens of Western democracies (e.g., the #resist crowd) look at some political Others (e.g., the #MAGA crowd), 
who are nominally part of their own nation, and ask, â€œWho are those people and why am I sharing political 
power with them?â€?The underlying tension of online tribes joined by now-dated political unions will persist until either the political borders 
are redrawn to reflect the virtual ones (e.g. Brexit, various secessionist murmurs among US states), or we somehow manage to 
unwrap our political identities from our online personas (unlikely). The pro-regulation crowd who argue Facebook is a utility (and therefore 
should be regulated like one) is partly correct; weâ€™ll no sooner part from our online identities at this point than 
we would from electricity or running water.Whatâ€™s the alternative?Some will retreat to atavistic revivals of earlier living arrangements: the organic 
farm, the militia compound, the anchorite â€œBenedict Option,â€? whereby conservative Christians isolate themselves from venal and corrupt modernity. Thereâ€™ll be 
escapees for sure.Â I myself ended up buying a raw patch of woods on Orcas Island, where I am learning the 
messy arts of composting toilets while (occasionally) enjoying the authentic community.But like so many things in our coming dysfunction, most 
people will have to resort to a knockoff of an erstwhile original. And thatâ€™s where Facebook will thrive as crutch, 
the opiate of the socially precarious and atomized masses, the Band-Aid on the social wound thatâ€™s festered to bursting.Zuckerberg is 
ultimately correct in his vision of â€œA More Open and Connected World,â€? and has been relentlessly capable of making it 
a reality. As examples, take some recent headlines: Teachers in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Oklahoma organized the biggest labor strikes 
in recent US history via Facebook groups, organizing for increased school funding more aggressively and effectively than their unions. Then 
thereâ€™s the bad: In Sri Lanka, anti-Muslim riots were organized via Facebook, requiring the government to do what Facebook was 
unwilling to do: shut Facebook down. Similar bad news comes from Myanmar and the Philippines.Facebook, and social networks like it, 
will indeed provide the makeshift community for those whose worlds are being destroyed around them, even as it also serves 
as megaphone for those doing the destroying. Promoting the former while discouraging the latter is the fundamental challenge that companies 
like Facebook face. Whatever the various national or political contexts where it may occur, that battle is the media battle 
of our age.Facing Up to Its ProblemsFacebook new focus on community might depress you.Facebook is making it easier to control 
your personal data.Mark Zuckerberg says it may take three years to fix Facebook. Related VideoBusinessMark Zuckerberg Senate Testimony HighlightsHighlights from

Data: 
	On Thursday, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee published more than 3,500 Facebook and Instagram ads linked to the 
Russian propaganda group Internet Research Agency, making it the largest trove of these ads the public has seen to date.Since 
last fall, when Facebook disclosed it had sold political ads to Russian actors in the run-up to the 2016 election, 
details about the IRA handiwork have trickled out mainly in the form of independent research, individual exhibits presented during congressional 
testimony, and an indictment of IRA officials by special counsel Robert Mueller. Facebook, meanwhile, has declined to share a comprehensive 
list of accounts and Pages associated with the IRA on Facebook and Instagram.With Thursday disclosure, the House Democrats are painting 
a fuller picture, which they hope will help assist in further research about the IRA extensive operation.Ultimately, by exposing these 
advertisements, we hope to better protect legitimate political expression and discussions and better safeguard Americans from having their information ecosystem 
polluted by foreign adversaries, wrote representative Adam Schiff, ranking member of the committee, in a statement. â€œWe will continue to 
work with Facebook and other tech companies to expose additional content, advertisements, and information as our investigation progresses.â€?The newly revealed 
ads, some of which are redacted to protect the privacy of innocent Facebook users, track closely to what already known 
about the IRA tactics. The ads date back to early 2015 and continue through August of 2017, covering topics including 
LGBT rights, Black Lives Matter, immigration, Islam, veteran issues, the Second Amendment, Texas secession, and the presidential candidates themselves. The 
Pages implicated in this disclosure largely mirror a list published last year by the Russian media outlet RBC, which until 
now has been the largest list of suspected accounts published anywhere. But there are new names in the House committee 
collection, too, including an account called Black guns matter, which had more than 4,000 likes in November of 2016.As was 
clear during the congressional hearings with tech giants last November, the IRA ads on Facebook and Instagram often staked out 
both sides of the same issue. One ad, created by the page United Muslims of America in June of 2016 
and targeted at people whose interests on Facebook included Hillary Clinton and the Muslim Brotherhood, showed Clinton smiling with a 
woman in a hijab. It invited people to an event entitled Support Hillary. Save American Muslims!House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence MinorityAnother ad, meanwhile, purchased by the page Stop A.I.â€”short for Stop All Invadersâ€”showed a photoshopped President Obama in the 
Oval Office, with an ISIS flag behind him. Obama was always a mere pawn in the hands of the Arabian 
Sheikhs, it reads in part. All these refugees, which we are about to take in, are soldiers with one simple 
goal. They are going to try to terrorize the nation.House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence MinoritySome of the ads promote 
real-world events organized by unwitting Facebook users. One such event, promoted by the page Black Matters, promoted a night of 
free legal help for immigrants. Another, published by the page Fit Black, promoted free self-defense classes run by a club 
called Black Fist. Buzzfeed News previously reported that IRA trolls had lured American fitness trainers to lead these classes, even 
going so far as to pay them $320 a month.HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYWhat made these ads so 
deceptive is they rarely looked like traditional political ads. Often, they dont mention a candidate or the election at all. 
Instead, they tear at the parts of the American social fabric that are already worn thin, stoking outrage about police 
brutality or the removal of Confederate statues.HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYThroughout Congress investigation into Russian meddling in the 
election, legislators have questioned tech leaders about how the IRA targeted the ads. Facebook has repeatedly said that the majority 
of ads were geographically targeted broadly to the United States, and the House trove backs that up. But some ads 
in the new collection, including a few published by the page Black Matters, specifically target cities with a history of 
headlines about racial unrest and police brutality, like Baltimore, Maryland, and Ferguson, Missouri. Others target by interest category. In January 
of 2016, a single ad for a page called Williams&amp;Kalvin, two YouTubers the IRA hired to promote news and video 
about the black community, targeted users age 18 to 45 who were interested in BlackNews.com, the color black, or HuffPost 
Black Voices but were not Hispanic or Asian American. Facebook says it has since revisited some of its targeting categories, 
eliminating one-third of the categories the IRA used.Williams&amp;Kalvin appears to be one of the pages that tested which messages would 
resonate most with audiences. Within a single hour on January 14, 2016, that page posted the same ad with two 
different messages. The ad that read Community about black social and racial issues! Like to subscribe! received two clicks. The 
ad that read Black Discrimination Awareness! Like to join! got 2,592. That kind of testing is common in digital advertising, 
but it suggests the IRA was operating at a certain level of sophistication.HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYHOUSE PERMANENT 
SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYFacebook has sought to downplay the damage caused by these ads, often emphasizing that the IRA 
spent just $100,000 on them, compared to the nearly $40 billion in ad revenue the company earned in 2017. But 
the House disclosure shows how far even a small sum can go. One ad, purchased on June 23, 2015, by 
the page LGBT United, cost 99.95 Russian rubles, or the equivalent of $1.59. That ad garnered 26 clicks and 374 
impressions in a single day. Looked at this way, Facebook argument that 50 percent of the ads cost less than 
$3 doesnt sound all that compelling.The ads also represent just a sliver of what the Russian trolls posted on Facebook 
and Instagram. While 3,500 sounds like a sizable number, IRA accounts published some 80,000 organic posts on Facebook and another 
120,000 on Instagram, reaching roughly 146 million Americans between the two.Since these ads ranâ€”and the world found out about itâ€”Facebook 
has announced significant changes that it says could ward off such malicious behavior in the future. In advance of this 
announcement, Facebook sent a bulleted list of these changes to reporters. Going forward, for instance, it requiring all political advertisers, 
including people advertising about hot-button issues such as abortion and gun rights, to provide a copy of their government-issued identification 
and an address to verify that they live in the United States. It will require similar verification for popular pages.The 
company will also begin labeling political ads as such, and, in June, it will launch a repository of political ads 
that includes information on the amount spent on the ad, its reach, and the demographics of the audience it targeted. 
That will eliminate the kind of blind confusion that has ensued over the last year regarding the very ads the 
House made public Thursday. Meanwhile, Facebook will scale its content moderation team to 20,000 people by the end of this 
year.The House Democrats say they plan to eventually publish the organic posts created by the Russian trolls as well. But 
even on its own, Thursday data dump could serve as a useful guide not only for researchers who are still 
mapping out the IRA tactics but also for other tech platformsâ€”like Reddit and Tumblrâ€”that didnt detect Russian trolls until far 
later than their larger counterparts. The goal, after all, is not just to recap what happened but to prevent it 
from happening again.Update: 10:10 am ET 05/10/18 This story has been updated to reflect that after publication, House Democrats revised 
the total number of ads from more than 3,300 to more than 3,500.Bad AdsSpecial counsel Robert Mueller indictment of the

Data: 
	How much do workers at tech firms make?The answer varies a lot, depending on the employer. The median employee 
at Amazon made $28,446 last year, according to new disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. At Facebook, the 
median employee made $240,430, more than eight times as much.There are reasons for the big disparity, of course: Facebookâ€™s 25,000 
employees include many software engineers, which it must recruit in the expensive and competitive San Francisco Bay Area. Most of 
Amazonâ€™s 566,000 employees work in its distribution centers, including many overseas; in the US, Amazon says the average hourly wage 
in its distribution centers is more than $15 an hour, which translates to slightly more than $30,000 a year, before 
overtime.Other disparities reflect differences in companiesâ€™ businesses, and business models. As a car maker, Tesla says 26 percent of its 
employees are production workers and 18 percent are outside the US. The company reported median employee pay of $54,816. Tesla 
says its employees also have benefited from increases in the companyâ€™s share price. IBM, which has aggressively moved jobs overseas 
in recent years, reported median pay of $54,491. The New York Times reported in September that IBM now has more 
employees in India than in the US. An IBM spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Even within the same 
tech sector, median pay can vary significantly based on a companyâ€™s business model. Intel, the largest US maker of semiconductors 
by revenue, makes its own chips. Three of its six manufacturing sites are in the US, as are half of 
its 102,000 employees. The company reported median pay of $102,100. Nvidia, whose graphics chips are used widely for machine learning 
and artificial intelligence, reported median pay of $147,640. The company contracts out the manufacturing of its chips and has only 
about 8,200 employees. A spokesperson says half of Nvidiaâ€™s employees are in the â€œhighly competitiveâ€? Silicon Valley market and that 
its employees are â€œhighly skilled, college educated, and have deep expertiseâ€“all of which command a premium in the market.â€?The median 
pay figures underscore that intense competition for tech talent in the Bay Area. Nationally, the average pay for software developers 
and programmers is $102,470, according to the US Labor Department. Bay Area tech firms are paying considerably more: The median 
pay at Workday, which makes software that helps businesses manage finances and people, is $178,903, according to its proxy statement. 
At Salesforce, another business-software maker, itâ€™s $155,284; and at payments processor Square, itâ€™s $152,265.Companies are disclosing the median pay of 
employees for the first time this year under a new SEC rule intended to shine a light on the high 
pay of CEOs. The rule took effect for fiscal years ending December 31, 2017, or later, so companies on different 
fiscal calendars, including Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, wonâ€™t report their median-pay figures until later this year.Companies have to report the 
ratio of the pay of their CEOs to the median pay of their employees. The Wall Street Journal reported that 
Marathon Petroleum CEO Gary Heminger was paid $19.7 million last year, or 935 times the $21,034 salary of the companyâ€™s 
median worker.The ratios are less meaningful for big tech companies because many of their CEOs are founders who own large 
chunks of the company and receive only nominal compensation. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey received no compensation, according to the companyâ€™s

Data: 
	Google wants to help its users take back their time.On Tuesday, at its annual developers conference, the company announced 
several new features designed to help people monitor and manage the time they spend on their devices. The goal: Enable 
users to understand their habits, control the demands technology places on their attention, and focus on what matters. Helping people 
with their digital well-being is more important to us than ever, said vice president of product management Sameer Samat. People 
tell us a lot of the time they spend on their phones is really useful. But some of it they 
wish theyd spent on other things.Or, to use an increasingly prevalent turn of phrase: People want the time on their 
devices to be time well spent. Popularized by Tristan Harris, a former product manager at Google and cofounder of the 
Center for Humane Technology, TWS has snowballed into a movement, reaching acronymic levels of recognition in tech circles and becoming 
a major talking point among the industry biggest companies.But while tech giants may be coming to grips with the disproportionate 
demand technology places on users time and attention, it still not clear how best to confront that imbalance. Much of 
what we know about technology allure is based not on peer-reviewed research but on anecdata. Here what the existing evidence 
has to say about the features Google unveiled this week.Step One: AwarenessGoogle thinks the first step toward reclaiming your time 
involves understanding your habits. On that front, the most comprehensive update is a systemwide tracking feature called Dashboard, which monitors 
at multiple levels howâ€”and how oftenâ€”you use your Android device. It can tell you things like how much time you 
spend on your phone, how much time you spend in specific apps, how often you unlock your phone, and how 
many notifications you receive on a daily basis.At first blush, Dashboard sounds a lot like Moment, a popular screen-time-tracking app 
designed by Kevin Holesh that been available for iOS since 2014. In the past four years, Holesh says he has 
received at least hundreds of emails from users who, upon using the app, discovered they spend twice as much time 
on their devices as they thought they did. (Peer-reviewed research on estimated vs. real-world smartphone use is lacking, but a 
small study published in 2015 found that test subjects, while good at guessing the time they spend on their devices, 
tend to underestimate the number of times they check their phones on a daily basis by more than half.)I asked 
Holesh to scrape some data on his users. Drawing from a randomly selected sample of 100,000 active customers, Holesh found 
that, among those that had downloaded the app and used it to monitor their activity at least 30 days, some 
56 percent had reduced their screen time by an average of 24 minutes.By building screen-tracking directly into its operating system, 
Holesh says, Google is poised to monitor usage patterns better than any third-party app could hope to achieve. Indeed, according 
to Samat, Dashboard will take usage tracking a step further than Moment currently does, by allowing developers to trackâ€”and then 
share with usersâ€”detailed information about how people use their apps.That data could be invaluable to users: Evidence suggests that the 
effects of screen time vary not only between apps but within them. Internal studies at Facebook suggest that people who 
spend time passively consuming information on the platform report feeling worse afterward, while people who spend their time actively engaging 
with other users experienced the opposite effect.The same may also be true of the way people use Twitter. Or Instagram. 
Or Gmail. That where the conversation with technology needs to go, and what Google is trying for here, because not 
all screen time is created equal, says Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist at the Oxford Internet Institute who studies the 
self-regulation of technology use.Step Two: ActionBut understanding your technological habits and taking control of them are two different things, which 
is why Google has paired Dashboard with another tool called App Timer. As its name suggests, the feature allows you 
to set a cap on the time you spend in given apps. Say you want to spend no more than 
30 minutes a day on Twitter. As you near your designated time limit, your phone will remind you that youre 
approaching your cutoff. Exceed your limit, and Twitter app icon will turn to gray on your home screen and, at 
least in the beta version of Android P, Google new mobile operating system, prevent you from opening the app.But these 
cues and roadblocks might have a smaller impact on user behavior than Google hopes. Again, data from Moment is instructive 
here: Recall that screen-time awareness alone led 56 percent of Moment customers to decrease their time on a device by 
an average of 24 minutes per day. Holesh says his app Daily Limit feature seems to only push about 6 
percent more of my customer base towards lowering their daily screen time. (The average decrease among those users is 26 
minutes). The daily limit feature is effective at reducing screen time, but only slightly, and not for a huge part 
of my customer base, Holesh says.In other words: To implement lasting change many people could require more help than an 
app timer.That where Google other updates could come into play. The first is Wind Down, which automatically sets your phone 
to Do Not Disturb and adjusts your display settings at a predesignated time.Like Apple Night Shift and Bed Time features, 
Wind Down is designed to help you get a better night sleep. But whereas iOS pursues this goal by shifting 
the temperature of your display from cool to warm, Android does it by changing your screen from color to grayscale.Which 
approach is better? Hard to say. A handful of studies do suggest that warm tones interfere less with your circadian 
rhythms, and your shut-eye, than cool onesâ€”but similar research is lacking on grayscale displays. Popular among the digital-detox set, a 
grayscale screen is thought to be less distracting than those on a colorful one, and marketing experts will tell you 
that designers have long relied on colors to encourage subconscious decisionmaking. But at least as of this writing, the evidence 
on grayscale screens is limited to conventional wisdom and anecdotes.Two additional updates include Shushâ€”a feature that allows you to set 
your phone to Do Not Disturb simply by flipping it faceside downâ€”and a new batched notifications setting that delivers all 
your YouTube notifications in the form of a once-daily digest. Multiple studies have linked phone alerts to inattention, hyperactivity, and 
anxiety. But the results of these studies are more nuanced than notifications = bad. What they actually show is that 
when and how notifications are delivered has a significant impact on test subjects self-reported well-being.One study led by computer scientist 
Luz Rello, of Carnegie Mellon Human Computer Interaction Institute, found that disabling notifications left some test subjects feeling less stressed 
and more productive during working hours but anxious in their off-time, for fear of missing important information and violating expectations 
of others. Another study presented earlier this year at the American Psychology Association conference of Technology, Mind, and Society found 
that test subjects who received their notifications in batches three times a day reported they felt significantly happier, more focused, 
and less stressed than those who received notifications as usual, or not at all.Too many notifications seemed to result in 
attentional overload. Too few seemed to lead to FOMO, or fear of missing out, says coauthor Kostadin Kushlev, a psychologist 
at the University of Virginia who studies how smartphone use can improve or detract from personal well-being.Essential to the current 
conversation surrounding Time Well Spent, it seems, is finding the balance between FOMO and what Google on Tuesday called JOMO: 
the joy of missing out. Also essential? More research.Overall the steps Google is taking are great, but I would really 
like to see some rigorous investigations that indicate people like the features, use them, and feel empowered by them, Przybylski 
says. Like, an empirical study. Or three. That means open and robust research. Registered, randomized controlled trials. Independent replications. It 
would be good for science and it would be good for the product, Przybylski says.And most of all, good for 
users.More from I/O:Google new features make life easierâ€”and they help the company collect more data on its users.Miss the big

Data: 
	Everyone knows Washington is a swamp filled with snakes and influence peddlers. And few believed President Trump would do 
much to change that, despite his drain the swamp battle cry. In fact, one could argue he has done much 
since taking office to encourage influence peddling.He refused to put his assets in a blind trust or release his tax 
returns. That means he can know which people, businesses, and countries that want something from him as president are also 
supporting him as a businessman. And even though he has said he wont seek that information, the public has no 
way to hold him accountable to that promise. A true cynic might wonder when companies would just start handing Trump 
personal attorney suitcases of cash every time they wanted access, or to know what was on his mind.Thatâ€™s not dark 
comedy anymore. The New York Times and Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for the porn star known as Stormy Daniels, both 
reported yesterday that, starting in 2016 and continuing through January, Michael Cohen, Trump personal attorney, accepted payments totaling more than 
$1.2 million from companies that may have wanted to influence Trump or sought information about Trump thinking. The money was 
paid to the same company, Essential Consultants, from which Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 shortly before the election not to talk 
about her alleged tryst with Trump.In all, Avenatti said, more than $4 million flowed through Essential Consultants from October 2016 
to January 2018. Investigators are trying to understand the motivations behind a $500,000 payment from Columbus Nova, a US investment 
firm with ties to a Russian oligarch connected to Russian president Vladimir Putin, according to the Times. Meanwhile pharmaceutical firm 
Novartis confirmed it paid Essential about $1.2 million and that it had cooperated fully with an inquiry from special counsel 
Robert Muellerâ€™s office. Novartis said it entered into a year-long agreement with Essential in February 2017. After one meeting, the 
company said, it â€œdetermined that Michael Cohen and Essential Consultants would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had 
anticipated,â€? but the company felt obligated to continue the payments under the contract.Of particular note to those in Hollywood and 
Silicon Valley were four payments totaling $200,000 from AT&amp;T to Essential from October 2017 through January 2018.Michael Cohen should not 
be selling access to the president of the United States. This is a big deal, Avenatti said on Anderson Cooper 
360Â° Tuesday night. He said it didnt take too much imagination to wonder whether some of the money paid to 
Cohen ended up in Trump pockets. Neither Trump nor Cohen have commented.USA Today White House correspondent Gregory Korte tweeted Wednesday 
that Cohen and AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson entered Trump Tower eight minutes apart on Jan. 12, 2017, according to a 
pool report at the time. 1https://twitter.com/gregorykorte/status/994253095277391872AT&amp;T had two reasons to be keenly interested in Trump thinking during that period. It, 
along with other wireless and cable companies, was pushing the Federal Communications Commission to end net neutrality, the rules that 
bar telecom companies from blocking or favoring certain content. It also needs government approval of its $85 billion proposed acquisition 
of Time Warner. To be fair, all corporations seek intelligence about the inner workings of new administrations. And corporations needed 
to work harder for intelligence about the basic workings of the Trump White House than with previous administrations, because Trump 
was an outsider surrounded by few of the well-known Washington hands.Asked about the relationship, AT&amp;T was not evasive. Essential Consulting 
was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration, AT&amp;T said 
in a statement Tuesday evening. They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 
2017.If AT&amp;T was looking to buy influence, it has a mixed record. The FCC under Trump appointee Ajit Pai voted 
3â€“2 in December to repeal its 2015 net neutrality rules, freeing telecom firms to create paid â€œfast lanesâ€? for certain 
content, or to exempt certain content from data caps in wireless plans, a concept known as â€œzero rating.â€? The move 
was strongly opposed by most Silicon Valley companies, some of whom are joining a â€œRed Alertâ€? day on the web 
Wednesday to support a congressional move to restore net neutrality.On the Time Warner merger, however, AT&amp;T has had less success. 
The Justice Department in November sued to block the deal as anticompetitive. Testimony in that trial ended last week, and 
the judge is expected to rule next month.1 CORRECTION, 5PM EDT: AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson and Michael Cohen both visited 
Trump Tower on Jan. 12, 2017. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said they both visited the White House.Trump 
TurmoilRobert Mueller likely knows how the Trump investigation ends.What Trump still gets wrong about how Russia played Facebook.Comcast acquisition of 
NBC holds few lessons for AT&amp;T-Time Warner. Related VideoSecurityWhy You Should Care About Net NeutralityA world without net neutrality might 
end up meaning that you have to pay more to access the internet content that you want. But it also 
might crush innovation.

Data: 
	This week, the United States officially backed out of the Iran nuclear deal. The geopolitical reverberations should continue to 
play out in a variety of fields, but make sure you count cybersecurity among them. Iran targeted the US frequentlyâ€”particularly 
financial institutions before the deal went into place. Security experts warn that with the agreement no longer in place, the 
barrage could begin again. So, look out for that!We also took a look at facial recognition technology. Law enforcement around 
the world uses it more than ever, but picking out a single face out of a crowd of 60,000 feels 
downright dystopianâ€”as does wrongly identifying several thousand people as potential criminals. It off-putting at either extreme, which seems like a 
decent argument to slow down its deployment.Microsoft, meanwhile, has introduced JavaScript to Excel, which makes security researchers as anxious as 
it delights hackers and phishers. Speaking of which, your Facebook and Twitter accounts are vulnerable. Here how to lock them 
down once and for all.And this isnt security, specifically, but if, hypothetically, Donald Trump had bought up so many properties 
in cash as part of an elaborate money laundering scheme? Here how that would work.And there more! As always, weâ€™ve 
rounded up all the news we didnâ€™t break or cover in depth this week. Click on the headlines to read 
the full stories. And stay safe out there.Researchers Send Secret Commands to Voice AssistantsYou know how dogs can hear noises 
you cant? Guess what! So can Alexa and Google Assistant and Siri. And while research along those lines has been 
fomenting for the last several years, a team from UC-Berkeley this month demonstrated that they can hide voice-assistant commands not 
just in white noise, but behind actual voices or music. It not a hack that appears to have hit the 
wild yet, but there every reason to expect that it will eventually. And given the amount that we offload to 
voice assistantsâ€”purchases, door locks, and moreâ€”that could have serious consequences.Signal Disappearing Messages Dont Always Disappear on MacsSignal remains our pick 
for the best encrypted messaging service. But those who use its desktop client with the default settings may have inadvertently 
stored those messages indefinitely on their Mac notification bar, even if they had been set to self-destruct. Not ideal! On 
Thursday, Signal pushed an update that should fix the issue, but just to be safe, any desktop Signal users should 
do what they can to triple check that messages they thought were gone forever really are.The Ring Video Doorbell Had 
a Major Security OversightOn the one hand, a video doorbell helps you increase your personal security, keeping close tabs on 
who coming and who going. On the other hand, yikes! Popular model Ring, recently acquired by Amazon, until recently wouldnt 
log users out of its app after the password changed. That meant that if you switched up your authentication to, 
say, deny access to an ex, they could still essentially spy on your front door. (In fact, that precisely what 
happened in an incident outlined by The Information.) Ring says it updated the app in January such that everyone has 
to log back in now after a password reset, but even now it doesnt take effect for several hours.A Service 
Can Track Nearly Any Cell Phone in the USAs if Facebook didnt give you enough surveillance hassles lately, The New 
York Times takes a look at a company called Securus, which advertises the ability to track nearly any cell phone 
in the US within seconds. Theyre able to do so because carriers regularly sell access to location services to third 
parties with no customer consent and little oversight. Meanwhile, not every state even requires a warrant to gather location data, 
which all adds up to a pretty nightmarish scenario of being snooped on without any knowledgeâ€”or any way to prevent 
it. Related VideoSecurityHow to Control What Alexa and Google Assistant Do With Your Voice DataVirtual assistants like Google Home and

Data: 
	Earlier this week, the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released roughly 3,500 Facebook and Instagram ads purchased by 
the Internet Research Agency, a notorious Russian troll farm. Among them: Ads purchased in May of 2016 that promoted a 
suspicious Chrome extension that gained wide access to the Facebook accounts and web browsing behavior of those who installed it.The 
ads, dozens in total, prompted users to install the extension, a music app called FaceMusic; when they did, some users 
reported that it began messaging all of their Facebook friends. The landing page for the ads, musicfb.info, was registered in 
April of 2016 in St. Petersburg, Russia, where the IRA is based.The most successful ad, which yielded 28 clicks, specifically 
targeted American girls, ages 14 to 17, who Facebook classified as interested in free software and music. Other ads for 
FaceMusic targeted interest categories like Shazam, Spotify, Apple Music, or Soundcloud.The ads containing the extension, purchased by the IRA phony 
anti-immigrant Facebook page Stop All Invaders, were discovered by Jonathan Albright, director of research at Columbia University Tow Center for 
Digital Journalism.Why would an anti-immigrant Russian Facebook Page be spending money to promote a music app? Albright says.HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT 
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYThe landing site that the ad directed to, musicfb.info, is no longer active, but an archived version 
advertises a â€œunique browser extension, which allows you to play your favorite music on Facebook for free and share it 
with your friends.â€?The extension is no longer active in the Chrome Web Store, either, and a Google spokesperson confirmed the 
company had also removed it from users devices. When we discover malicious extensions, we remove them from the Chrome Web 
Store and from every user computer that has downloaded them, the spokesperson said. We suspend the developer and remove their 
other extensions from the Store as well.Facebook could not confirm the number of people who signed into the extension through 
Facebook. It also unclear how many installed the extension after seeing the IRA Facebook ads. In total, the ads received 
just over 80 clicks, according to the metadata released by Facebook. Most of the ads received no clicks at all, 
likely because they had nothing to do with the other content posted by the Stop All Invaders page, which included, 
among other things, photoshopped memes calling President Obama a mere pawn in the hands of the Arabian Sheikhs.Facebook also wasnâ€™t 
the only platform where the IRA promoted FaceMusic. A Reddit user named Rubinjer, which Reddit has since identified as linked 
to the IRA, also posted it to the subreddit r/UsefulWebsites.Though the extension has been removed from the Chrome Web Store, 
JÃ©rÃ´me Segura, a researcher at the security firm Malwarebytes Labs, found an archived version of FaceMusic and installed it manually. 
He found that the extension asked users for permission to read and change all your data on the websites you 
visit, display notifications, and modify data you copy and paste.courtesy MalwarebytesIt also had permission to post to usersâ€™ Facebook timelines 
and message their friends. It apparently took full advantage. In June of 2016, a month after the IRAâ€™s ads went 
live, one user took to the online photo-sharing site Imgur to complain that FaceMusic had spammed their friends with Facebook 
messages. Facemusic sent a direct link to download their extension, to 100+ of my friends, the user wrote. PLEASE, DO 
NOT GET Facemusic!!! If you have it, GET RID OF IT IMMEDIATELY, change your FB password, and [perform] a virus 
scan. Several other users responded that the same had happened to them.Weâ€™ve seen examples of using a lure, like a 
music app or a game, for other purposes, says Segura. He notes, though, that the extension itself doesnt seem to 
contain malicious code, and received a clean bill of health from more than 50 antivirus engines. Instead, it used Facebook 
and Google generous permissions to access users data and message their friends.Segura says that these permissions, while broad, are fairly 
standard for Chrome extensions, which often overreach the boundaries of privacy. They have too many privileges. You download a game 
and all you want is the game, but the game wants contacts from your phone, he says. In the hands 
of a group like the IRA, that kind of unchecked power can go very wrong.Bad AdsThe 3,500 ads Congress released

Data: 
	Earlier this week, Facebook announced a grand reshuffle of its leadership. First reported by Recode, the new structure includes 
teams for the companyâ€™s apps, new platforms and infrastructure, and central product services. Most of the people moving into new 
roles have been with the company for close to a decade or longer, and many have proven themselves adept at 
the skill Facebook appears to value over all others: growth.Chris Cox Is the New Mark ZuckerbergIf there were ever a 
question as to who would step in to fill Zuckerbergâ€™s shoes should something happen to him, it has been resolved. 
With his new role as head of the companyâ€™s family of appsâ€”Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and the tried and true Big 
Blue (aka Facebook)â€”Facebookâ€™s chief product officer is stepping out as the leader he has long been internally. Anyone paying close 
attention knows this already.Cox, who is very close friends with Zuckerberg, dropped out of a Stanford graduate program to join 
Facebook in 2005. Heâ€™s done a lot of jobs since. When I first met him in 2008, he was the 
25-year-old head of resources who zipped around the office on a ripstik. An engineer by training, he helped invent news 
feed and was the star of the video Facebook showed investors in the run-up to its initial public offering. Cox 
is a brilliant public face for the company because he pairs engineering rigor and Facebook history with an emotive voice 
that Zuckerberg sometimes lacks. (Check out his F8 keynote from 2011 to see this in action.)Coxâ€™s new role also suggests 
Facebook will integrate Instagram and WhatsApp more deeply into the company, now that theyâ€™re organizationally closer to Messenger and Facebook. 
This may have contributed to WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koumâ€™s departure last month.Javier Olivan Just Got a Lot More ImportantOf Zuckerbergâ€™s 
three direct reports on the product side of the business, Olivan is the only one not currently on Facebookâ€™s leadership 
page. The Spanish native arrived at Facebook after finishing his Stanford MBA in 2007 to run international growth, when the 
company had just 40 million users, most in the United States. The growth team is Facebookâ€™s Navy SEALs, a special-operations 
force brought in when the company sees potential for a feature to take off and the stakes are high. Historically, 
most teams at Facebook have included one of Olivanâ€™s direct reports.Olivanâ€™s responsibilities now include ad products, analytics, and a group 
called â€œintegrity, growth, and product management.â€? One could also read this as one way Zuckerberg is demoting ad products. Mark 
Rabkin, who is in charge, now reports to Olivan.Controversy Wont Stop WhatsAppâ€™s New BossUnlike its Instagram acquisition, Facebookâ€™s acquisition of 
WhatsApp was never a great culture fit. Koum promised to keep WhatsApp ad-free, then sold it to an ad company. 
In March, cofounder Brian Acton, whoâ€™d already left Facebook to start a foundation, advised his 35,000 Twitter followers to #Deletefacebook. 
Then last month, Koum announced he was leaving his post as WhatsAppâ€™s CEO and stepping off Facebookâ€™s board.Now Chris Daniels, 
a seven-year Facebook veteran, steps in to replace Koum, eschewing the title as CEO of WhatsApp for a vice president 
title. It will be on Daniels, who will report to Cox, to sort out a business for the messaging service. 
Heâ€™s got the experience to take on the challenge. Until recently, Daniels ran Facebookâ€™s internet.org initiatives around expanding access in 
developing countries. The largest of these projects is Free Basics, an app that offers access to free web services. Although 
telecom companies rejected the idea of partnering with Facebook to provide the Free Basics app early onâ€”and India banned it 
in 2016â€”more than 80 carriers partner with Facebook to offer the service.Facebook Probably Has a Blockchain PlanDavid Marcus, who ran 
Facebookâ€™s Messenger app, will now lead a team of fewer than a dozen people dedicated to blockchain technology. Kevin Weil, 
who was in charge of product at Instagram, is joining him along with James Everingham, who was in charge of 
engineering there. (WIREDâ€™s Erin Griffith and Sandra Upson have some thoughts on what this means.)A board member of cryptocurrency wallet 
Coinbase with a lot of payments experience, Marcus has a history of leaving large posts to take up seemingly small 
projects. He was CEO of PayPal in 2014 when he left to run Messenger. The move was a head-scratcher: At 
the time, Messenger was a tiny messaging app that had failed to take off as an email replacement. But Zuckerberg 
had a plan to transform Messenger into a better version of WhatsApp (which, it should be said, heâ€™d just bought), 
one that businesses could harness to reach users in new ways.Messengerâ€™s Chief is a Growth ExpertReplacing Marcus at Messenger is 
Stan Chudnovsky. Heâ€™s one of the newer members of the leadership bench, having arrived at Facebook in 2014. Like Marcus, 
Chudnovsky is a serial entrepreneur; he sold his last company, the software startup IronPearl, to PayPal before it was a 
year old. Chudnovskyâ€™s nascent startup had been building growth tools for companies, and at PayPal he was head of growth. 
At Messenger, Chudnovsky worked closely with Marcus to grow Messenger into a service with more than 1.3 billion monthly active 
users.There Are Almost No Women HereA shamefully obvious aspect of the image of the org chart that Recode pieced together 
earlier this week is the paucity of female faces. In fact, thereâ€™s only one: Naomi Gleit, who now runs â€œintegrity, 
growth and product management.â€? Gleit, who is Facebookâ€™s longest tenured employee (she was #29), has long been part of the 
growth team at Facebook and was until recently the companyâ€™s â€œvice president of social good.â€? Gleit is a force to 
be reckoned with, no doubt. But this new structure raises questions about Zuckerbergâ€™s commitment to building an inclusive workforce. For 
as much as the company has benefitted from the work its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has done personally to 
promote women, it should be unacceptable for Zuckerberg to fill 13 of the companyâ€™s 14 most critical technical positions with 
men.A New Face(book)What the deal with Facebook and the blockchain?House Democrats recently released 3,500 Russia-linked Facebook ads.Here what Facebook wont

Data: 
	Lawmakers, child development experts, and privacy advocates are expressing concerns about two new Amazon products targeting children, questioning whether 
they prod kids to be too dependent on technology and potentially jeopardize their privacy.In a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff 
Bezos on Friday, two members of the bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus raised concerns about Amazonâ€™s smart speaker Echo Dot Kids 
and a companion service called FreeTime Unlimited that lets kids access a childrenâ€™s version of Alexa, Amazonâ€™s voice-controlled digital assistant.â€œWhile 
these types of artificial intelligence and voice recognition technology offer potentially new educational and entertainment opportunities, Americansâ€™ privacy, particularly childrenâ€™s 
privacy, must be paramount,â€? wrote Senator Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) and Representative Joe Barton (R-Texas), both cofounders of the privacy caucus.The 
letter includes a dozen questions, including requests for details about how audio of childrenâ€™s interactions is recorded and saved, parental 
control over deleting recordings, a list of third parties with access to the data, whether data will be used for 
marketing purposes, and Amazonâ€™s intentions on maintaining a profile on kids who use these products.In a statement, Amazon said it 
takes privacy and security seriously. The company said Echo Dot Kids Edition uses on-device software to detect the wake word 
and only the wake word. Only once the wake word is detected does it start streaming to the cloud, and 
it will present a visual indication (the light ring at the top of the device turns blue) to show that 
it is streaming to the cloud.Echo Dot Kids is the latest in a wave of products from dominant tech players 
targeting children, including Facebookâ€™s communications app Messenger Kids and Googleâ€™s YouTube Kids, both of which have been criticized by child 
health experts concerned about privacy and developmental issues.Like Amazon, toy manufacturers are also interested in developing smart speakers that would 
live in a childâ€™s room. In September, Mattel pulled Aristotle, a smart speaker and digital assistant aimed at children, after 
a similar letter from Markey and Barton, as well as a petition that garnered more than 15,000 signatures.One of the 
organizers of the petition, the nonprofit group Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, is now spearheading a similar effort against 
Amazon. In a press release Friday, timed to the letter from Congress, a group of child development and privacy advocates 
urged parents not to purchase Echo Dot Kids because the device and companion voice service pose a threat to childrenâ€™s 
privacy and well-being.â€œAmazon wants kids to be dependent on its data-gathering device from the moment they wake up until they 
go to bed at night,â€? said the groupâ€™s executive director Josh Golin. â€œThe Echo Dot Kids is another unnecessary â€˜must-haveâ€™ 
gadget, and itâ€™s also potentially harmful. AI devices raise a host of privacy concerns and interfere with the face-to-face interactions 
and self-driven play that children need to thrive.â€?FreeTime on Alexa includes content targeted at children, like kidsâ€™ books and Alexa 
skills from Disney, Nickelodeon, and National Geographic. It also features parental controls, such as song filtering, bedtime limits, disabled voice 
purchasing, and positive reinforcement for using the word â€œplease.â€?Despite such controls, the child health experts warning against Echo Dot Kids 
wrote, â€œUltimately, though, the device is designed to make kids dependent on Alexa for information and entertainment. Amazon even encourages 
kids to tell the device â€˜Alexa, Iâ€™m bored,â€™ to which Alexa will respond with branded games and content.â€?In Amazonâ€™s April 
press release announcing Echo Dot Kids, the company quoted one representative from a nonprofit group focused on children that supported 
the product, Stephen Balkam, founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute. Balkam referenced a report from his institute, 
which found that the majority of parents were comfortable with their child using a smart speaker. Although it was not 
noted in the press release, Amazon is a member of FOSI and has an executive on the board.In a statement 
to WIRED, Amazon said, We believe one of the core benefits of FreeTime and FreeTime Unlimited is that the services 
provide parents the tools they need to help manage the interactions between their child and Alexa as they see fit. 
Amazon said parents can review and listen to their childrenâ€™s voice recordings in the Alexa app, review FreeTime Unlimited activity 
via the Parent Dashboard, set bedtime limits or pause the device whenever theyâ€™d like.Balkam said his institute disclosed Amazon funding 
of its research on its website and the cover of its report. Amazon did not initiate the study. Balkam said 
the institute annually proposes a research project, and reaches out to its members, a group that also includes Facebook, Google, 
and Microsoft, who pay an annual stipend of $30,000. â€œAmazon stepped up and we worked with them. They gave us 
editorial control and we obviously gave them recognition for the financial support,â€? he said.Balkam says Echo Dot Kids addresses concerns 
from parents about excessive screen time. â€œItâ€™s screen-less, itâ€™s very interactive, itâ€™s kid friendly,â€? he said, pointing out Alexa skills 
that encourage kids to go outside.In its review of the product, BuzzFeed wrote, â€œUnless your parents purge it, your Alexa 
will hold on to every bit of data you have ever given it, all the way back to the first 
things you shouted at it as a 2-year-old.â€?Far From Sesame StreetFacebook funded most of the experts who vetted its Messenger 
Kids, an app for children as young as 6.Child-health advocates asked Facebook to discontinue Messenger Kids, claiming it will undermine 
childhood development.In a complaint to the FTC, child health and privacy groups allege that YouTube is violating a law that 
protects children online. Related VideoTechnologySeniors React to Amazon EchoWIRED asks a group of seniors what they think about Amazon Echo. 
Can they stump our new favorite digital assistant, Alexa?

Title: Online Ad Targeting Does Work&#8212;As Long As Its Not Creepy

Data: 
	If you click on the right-hand corner of any advertisement on Facebook, the social network will tell you why 
it was targeted to you. But what would happen if those buried targeting tactics were transparently displayed, right next to 
the ad itself? That the question at the heart of new research from Harvard Business School published in the Journal 
of Consumer Research. It turns out advertising transparency can be good for a platformâ€”but it depends on how creepy marketer 
methods are.The study has wide-reaching implications for advertising giants like Facebook and Google, which increasingly find themselves under pressure to 
disclose more about their targeting practices. The researchers found, for example, that consumers are reluctant to engage with ads that 
they know have been served based on their activity on third-party websites, a tactic Facebook and Google routinely use. Which 
also suggests that tech giants have a financial incentive to ensure users arent aware, at least up front, about how 
some ads are served.Dont Talk Behind My BackFor their study, Tami Kim, Kate Barasz and Leslie K. John conducted a 
number of online advertising experiments to understand the effect transparency has on user behavior. They found that if sites tell 
you theyre using unsavory tacticsâ€”like tracking you across the webâ€”youre far less likely to engage with their ads. The same 
goes for other invasive methods, like inferring something about your life when you havent explicitly provided that information. A famous 
example of this is from 2012, when Target began sending a woman baby-focused marketing mailers, inadvertently divulging to her father 
that she was pregnant.I think it will be interesting to see how firms respond in this age of increasing transparency, 
says John, a professor at Harvard Business School and one of the authors of the paper. Third-party data sharing obviously 
plays a big part in behaviorally targeted advertising. And behaviorally targeted advertising has been shown to be very effectiveâ€”in that 
it increases sales. But our research shows that when we become aware of third-party sharingâ€”and also of firms making inferences 
about usâ€”we feel intruded upon and as a result ad effectiveness can decline.The researchers didnt find, however, that users react 
poorly to all forms of ad transparency. If companies readily disclose that they employ targeting methods perceived to be acceptable, 
like recommending products based on items youve clicked in the past, people will make purchases all the same. And the 
study suggests that if people already trust the platform where those ads are displayed, they might even be more likely 
to click and buy.When we become aware of third-party sharingâ€”and also of firms making inferences about usâ€”we feel intruded upon.Leslie 
K. John, Harvard Business SchoolThe researchers say their findings mimic social truths in the real world. Tracking users across websites 
is viewed as an an inappropriate flow of information, like talking behind a friend back. Similarly, making inferences is often 
seen as unacceptable, even if youre drawing a conclusion the other person would freely disclose. For example, you might tell 
a friend that youre trying to lose weight, but find it inappropriate for him to ask if you want to 
shed some pounds. The same sort of rules apply to the online world, according to the study.And this brings to 
the topic that excites me the mostâ€”norms in the digital space are still evolving and less well understood, says Kim, 
the lead author of the study and a marketing professor at the University of Virginia business school. For marketers to 
build relationships with consumers effectively, itâ€™s critical for firms to understand what these norms are and avoid practices that violate 
these norms.Whered That Ad Come From?In one experiment, the researchers recruited 449 people from Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to look 
at ads for a fictional bookstore. They were randomly shown two different ad-transparency messages, one saying they were targeted based 
on products theyve clicked on in the past, and one saying they were targeted based on their activity on other 
websites. The study found that ads appended with the second messageâ€”revealing that users had been tracked across the webâ€”were 24 
percent less effective. (For the lab studies, effectiveness was based on how the subjects felt about the ads.)In another experiment, 
the researchers looked at whether ads are less effective when companies disclose theyre making inferences about their users. In this 
scenario, 348 participants were shown an ad for an art gallery, along with a message saying either they were seeing 
the ad based on your information that you stated about you, or based on your information that we inferred about 
you. In this study, ads were less 17 percent effective when it was revealed that they were targeted based on 
things a website concluded about you on its own, rather than facts you actively provided.The researchers found that their control 
ads, which didnt have any transparency messages, performed just as well as those with acceptable ad-transparency disclosuresâ€”implying that being up-front 
about targeting might not impact a company bottom line, as long as it not being creepy. The problem is that 
companies do sometimes use unsettling tactics; the Intercept discovered earlier this month, for example, that Facebook has developed a service 
designed to serve ads based on how it predicts consumers will behave in the future.In yet another experiment, the academics 
asked 462 participants to log into their Facebook accounts and look at the first ad they saw. They then were 
instructed to copy and paste Facebook Why am I seeing this ad message, as well as the name of the 
company that purchased it. Responses included standard targeting methods, like my age I stated on my profile, as well as 
invasive, distressing tactics like my sexual orientation that Facebook inferred based on my Facebook usage.Journal of Consumer ResearchThe researchers coded 
these responses, and gave them each a transparency score. The higher the score, the more acceptable the ad-targeting practice. The 
subjects were then asked how interested they were in the ad, including whether they would purchase something from the company 
website. The results show participants who were served ads using acceptable practices were more likely to engage than those who 
were served ads based on practices perceived to be unacceptable.Then, the researchers tested whether users who distrusted Facebook were less 
likely to engage with an ad; they found both that and the reverse to be true. People who trust Facebook 
more are more likely to engage with advertisementsâ€”though they have to be targeted in accepted ways. In other words, Facebook 
has a financial incentive beyond public relations to ensure users trust it. When they dont, people engage with advertisements less.Journal 
of Consumer ResearchWhat I think will be interesting moving forward is what users define for themselves as transparency. That definition 
is rapidly changing, and how platforms define it may not align with how users want or need it defined to 
feel like they understand, says Susan Wenograd, a digital advertising consultant with a Facebook focus. No one thought much of 
quizzes and apps being tied to Facebook before, but of course they do now since the testimony regarding Cambridge Analytica. 
It a fine line to be transparent without scaring users.When Transparency Works For EveryoneIn some situations, according to the study, 
being honest about targeting practices can even lead to more clicks and purchases. In another experiment, the researchers worked with 
two loyalty point-redemption programs, which previous research has shown consumers trust highly. When they showed people messages next to ads 
saying things like recommended based on your clicks on our site, they were more likely to click and make purchases 
than if no message was present.That says being honest can actually improve a company bottom lineâ€”as long as theyre not 
tracking and targeting users in an invasive way. As the researchers wrote, even the most personalized, perfectly targeted advertisement will 
flop if the consumer is more focused on the (un)acceptability of how the targeting was done in the first place.The

Data: 
	It will come as a surprise to many, particularly given its prominence in the never-ending Facebook news cycle, what 
a recent invention â€œprivacyâ€? is. The right to live as a stranger among strangers, with an inviolable sanctity of personal 
affairs against government or corporate intrusion, is a relatively new concept. The Oxford English Dictionary cites our current definition back 
to only 1814, and the first serious legal review of the conceptâ€”the now-classic The Right to Privacyâ€”was written by Louis 
Brandeis in 1890. Google Books, which has scanned and digitized a canon of books going back centuries, doesnâ€™t show much 
usage of the word until the 1960s.This relatively recent interest in, and legal defense of, privacy was a result of 
industrialization, rapidly growing cities, and the fraying of a local social fabric that once enmeshed (to not say ensnared) everyone 
within a set of expectations and possibilities. Privacy was and is a coping mechanism, a sanctuary from the increasingly anonymous 
and policed world to which modern man has migrated, and the technologies he confronted there. Brandeis cited the rise of 
newspapers and cheap photography as the motivating factors for his study, and the soon-to-be-enforced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from 
the European Union, aimed squarely at Google and Facebook, is another such reactive piece of jurisprudence.Antonio GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez (@antoniogm) is 
an Ideas contributor for WIRED. Before turning to writing, he dropped out of a doctoral program in physics to work 
on Goldman Sachsâ€™ credit trading desk, then joined the Silicon Valley startup world, where he founded his own startup (acquired 
by Twitter in 2011), and finally joined Facebookâ€™s early monetization team, where he headed its targeting efforts. His 2016 memoir, 
Chaos Monkeys, was a New York Times best seller and NPR Best Book of the Year, and his writing has 
appeared in Vanity Fair, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. He splits his time between a sailboat on the SF 
Bay and a yurt in Washingtonâ€™s San Juan Islands.However, in the hunter-gatherer tribes where humans evolved, or in the small 
towns where most Westerners lived until relatively recently, there was no notion of privacy. If you tried explaining privacy to 
a !Kung tribesman of the Kalahari Desert, or a late 18th-century French villager, theyâ€™d have no idea what you were 
talking about. Family sleeping arrangements were often communal and on a single bed until the Victorian Era, and generation after 
generation of families were born and buried alongside each other in ancestral townships that harbored few secrets. Meeting a stranger 
was likely a memorable event, and most pre-modern Westerners rarely interacted with anyone for whom they did not have a 
lengthy oral rap sheet.Iâ€™ve experienced whatâ€™s left of this communal life myself. In 2016, to write my memoir about building 
part of Facebookâ€™s monetization machine, I moved to a small, remote island in the Pacific Northwest, just shy of the 
Canadian border. After years adrift within the atomized, flaky world of San Francisco tech (where two people sitting 10 feet 
apart message each other via their smartphones), small-town life was a revelation. There, Facebook was completely unnecessary. Checking into a 
bar was automatic; the one you were at was the one open for business, and everyone who was not home 
was there.Â Every encounter involved a 10-minute recap of everything going on with your mutual friends, an impromptu, real-life news feed. 
What need was there for Facebook?Most notably, there was no privacy: Everyone knew who the drunk, the cheat, or the 
adulterer was. News flew almost as fast as Wi-Fi signals, and I met strangers whoâ€™d already gotten the download on 
who I was and what I was doing there (as one Facebook-stalks an online date).Deep down we hunger for that 
sense of community, and weâ€™ll find an outlet for it no matter what. If a platform can create the feeling 
of communityâ€”and Facebook is nothing if not an ersatz versionâ€”then the lack of privacy is fine, as it was on 
my island and throughout most of human history. Ultimately, nobody really cares about privacy, except media elites, under-employed Eurocrats, and 
zealots whoâ€™ve made it a career. Everyone else would sext you their privates for a fleeting feeling of human connection. 
And they do.(Donâ€™t agree with me? Think people really care about privacy? Hereâ€™s a pop quiz: When, during the past 
year, did Facebookâ€™s app have its highest ranking in the Google Play store? Answer: In late March, immediately after #deletefacebook 
went viral. People deleted their Facebook app in a fit of indignant furyâ€”and then re-installed it in droves, like a 
smoker quitting for a day and then buying a carton of smokes. Thereâ€™s now a privacy-industrial complex that strives relentlessly 
to keep itself relevant, but almost nobodyâ€™s behavior really changes.)As it turns out, Mark Zuckerberg mostly agrees with this Facebook-as-community 
metaphor, though heâ€™d express it more delicately. In February 2017, he published an unusual 6,000-word manifesto that, unlike most of 
his somewhat bland posts, is worth reading. There, he very immodestly proposes that Facebook occupy the social nexus vacated by 
the disappearance of churches, unions, lodges, and other local associations that once served as core of American civil life. This 
resurrected public forum would be as abstract and mobile as a Facebook group, and would no longer be restricted by 
the pesky limits of distance or national origin.This Facebook-as-community proxy is not without its problems, though, and itâ€™s where the 
smartphone version deviates from the real-world version that we encounter our modern pathologies. First, thereâ€™s the issue of overuse. Facebook 
is to real community as porn is to real sex: a cheap, digital knockoff for those who canâ€™t do better. 
Unfortunately, in both instances use of the simulacrum fries your brain in ways that prevent you from ever experiencing the 
real version again.Â But weâ€™ll take what we can get.The second major bug is geography. That slim piece of glass, metal, 
and silicon we keep in our pockets is like our own mobile Pacific Northwest island. Dunbarâ€™s number, the 150-or-so people 
that anthropologists have found most humans maintain as a social community, now lives in an easy-to-carry package.But that intangible network 
exists across space or even time, and therein lies the political problem. The fault lines of our new online polities 
run under and through the borders of the old, legacy ones. They donâ€™t respect the colored boxes on the map, 
boxes that used to refer to a common set of values, laws, and identities, but no longer do.Take the Blue 
State #resist voter as an example. That person is nominally a citizen of a continental nation-state that stretches â€œfrom sea 
to shining sea,â€? but more often sees herself as an inhabitant of an urban archipelago (and accompanying mediascape) stretching from 
Vancouver to Berlin. On the other side of our great divide, the Red State #MAGA voter from the Deep South 
has more in common with a UKIP-voting Brexiter in Leeds, or a Putin-supporting Russian nationalist, than with his metropolitan compatriots.This 
whole Facebook fracas is really the earthquake resulting from the realignment of these tribal tectonic plates underneath legacy states.Â Which is 
why so many citizens of Western democracies (e.g., the #resist crowd) look at some political Others (e.g., the #MAGA crowd), 
who are nominally part of their own nation, and ask, â€œWho are those people and why am I sharing political 
power with them?â€?The underlying tension of online tribes joined by now-dated political unions will persist until either the political borders 
are redrawn to reflect the virtual ones (e.g. Brexit, various secessionist murmurs among US states), or we somehow manage to 
unwrap our political identities from our online personas (unlikely). The pro-regulation crowd who argue Facebook is a utility (and therefore 
should be regulated like one) is partly correct; weâ€™ll no sooner part from our online identities at this point than 
we would from electricity or running water.Whatâ€™s the alternative?Some will retreat to atavistic revivals of earlier living arrangements: the organic 
farm, the militia compound, the anchorite â€œBenedict Option,â€? whereby conservative Christians isolate themselves from venal and corrupt modernity. Thereâ€™ll be 
escapees for sure.Â I myself ended up buying a raw patch of woods on Orcas Island, where I am learning the 
messy arts of composting toilets while (occasionally) enjoying the authentic community.But like so many things in our coming dysfunction, most 
people will have to resort to a knockoff of an erstwhile original. And thatâ€™s where Facebook will thrive as crutch, 
the opiate of the socially precarious and atomized masses, the Band-Aid on the social wound thatâ€™s festered to bursting.Zuckerberg is 
ultimately correct in his vision of â€œA More Open and Connected World,â€? and has been relentlessly capable of making it 
a reality. As examples, take some recent headlines: Teachers in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Oklahoma organized the biggest labor strikes 
in recent US history via Facebook groups, organizing for increased school funding more aggressively and effectively than their unions. Then 
thereâ€™s the bad: In Sri Lanka, anti-Muslim riots were organized via Facebook, requiring the government to do what Facebook was 
unwilling to do: shut Facebook down. Similar bad news comes from Myanmar and the Philippines.Facebook, and social networks like it, 
will indeed provide the makeshift community for those whose worlds are being destroyed around them, even as it also serves 
as megaphone for those doing the destroying. Promoting the former while discouraging the latter is the fundamental challenge that companies 
like Facebook face. Whatever the various national or political contexts where it may occur, that battle is the media battle 
of our age.Facing Up to Its ProblemsFacebook new focus on community might depress you.Facebook is making it easier to control 
your personal data.Mark Zuckerberg says it may take three years to fix Facebook. Related VideoBusinessMark Zuckerberg Senate Testimony HighlightsHighlights from

Data: 
	On Thursday, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee published more than 3,500 Facebook and Instagram ads linked to the 
Russian propaganda group Internet Research Agency, making it the largest trove of these ads the public has seen to date.Since 
last fall, when Facebook disclosed it had sold political ads to Russian actors in the run-up to the 2016 election, 
details about the IRA handiwork have trickled out mainly in the form of independent research, individual exhibits presented during congressional 
testimony, and an indictment of IRA officials by special counsel Robert Mueller. Facebook, meanwhile, has declined to share a comprehensive 
list of accounts and Pages associated with the IRA on Facebook and Instagram.With Thursday disclosure, the House Democrats are painting 
a fuller picture, which they hope will help assist in further research about the IRA extensive operation.Ultimately, by exposing these 
advertisements, we hope to better protect legitimate political expression and discussions and better safeguard Americans from having their information ecosystem 
polluted by foreign adversaries, wrote representative Adam Schiff, ranking member of the committee, in a statement. â€œWe will continue to 
work with Facebook and other tech companies to expose additional content, advertisements, and information as our investigation progresses.â€?The newly revealed 
ads, some of which are redacted to protect the privacy of innocent Facebook users, track closely to what already known 
about the IRA tactics. The ads date back to early 2015 and continue through August of 2017, covering topics including 
LGBT rights, Black Lives Matter, immigration, Islam, veteran issues, the Second Amendment, Texas secession, and the presidential candidates themselves. The 
Pages implicated in this disclosure largely mirror a list published last year by the Russian media outlet RBC, which until 
now has been the largest list of suspected accounts published anywhere. But there are new names in the House committee 
collection, too, including an account called Black guns matter, which had more than 4,000 likes in November of 2016.As was 
clear during the congressional hearings with tech giants last November, the IRA ads on Facebook and Instagram often staked out 
both sides of the same issue. One ad, created by the page United Muslims of America in June of 2016 
and targeted at people whose interests on Facebook included Hillary Clinton and the Muslim Brotherhood, showed Clinton smiling with a 
woman in a hijab. It invited people to an event entitled Support Hillary. Save American Muslims!House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence MinorityAnother ad, meanwhile, purchased by the page Stop A.I.â€”short for Stop All Invadersâ€”showed a photoshopped President Obama in the 
Oval Office, with an ISIS flag behind him. Obama was always a mere pawn in the hands of the Arabian 
Sheikhs, it reads in part. All these refugees, which we are about to take in, are soldiers with one simple 
goal. They are going to try to terrorize the nation.House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence MinoritySome of the ads promote 
real-world events organized by unwitting Facebook users. One such event, promoted by the page Black Matters, promoted a night of 
free legal help for immigrants. Another, published by the page Fit Black, promoted free self-defense classes run by a club 
called Black Fist. Buzzfeed News previously reported that IRA trolls had lured American fitness trainers to lead these classes, even 
going so far as to pay them $320 a month.HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYWhat made these ads so 
deceptive is they rarely looked like traditional political ads. Often, they dont mention a candidate or the election at all. 
Instead, they tear at the parts of the American social fabric that are already worn thin, stoking outrage about police 
brutality or the removal of Confederate statues.HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYThroughout Congress investigation into Russian meddling in the 
election, legislators have questioned tech leaders about how the IRA targeted the ads. Facebook has repeatedly said that the majority 
of ads were geographically targeted broadly to the United States, and the House trove backs that up. But some ads 
in the new collection, including a few published by the page Black Matters, specifically target cities with a history of 
headlines about racial unrest and police brutality, like Baltimore, Maryland, and Ferguson, Missouri. Others target by interest category. In January 
of 2016, a single ad for a page called Williams&amp;Kalvin, two YouTubers the IRA hired to promote news and video 
about the black community, targeted users age 18 to 45 who were interested in BlackNews.com, the color black, or HuffPost 
Black Voices but were not Hispanic or Asian American. Facebook says it has since revisited some of its targeting categories, 
eliminating one-third of the categories the IRA used.Williams&amp;Kalvin appears to be one of the pages that tested which messages would 
resonate most with audiences. Within a single hour on January 14, 2016, that page posted the same ad with two 
different messages. The ad that read Community about black social and racial issues! Like to subscribe! received two clicks. The 
ad that read Black Discrimination Awareness! Like to join! got 2,592. That kind of testing is common in digital advertising, 
but it suggests the IRA was operating at a certain level of sophistication.HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYHOUSE PERMANENT 
SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE MINORITYFacebook has sought to downplay the damage caused by these ads, often emphasizing that the IRA 
spent just $100,000 on them, compared to the nearly $40 billion in ad revenue the company earned in 2017. But 
the House disclosure shows how far even a small sum can go. One ad, purchased on June 23, 2015, by 
the page LGBT United, cost 99.95 Russian rubles, or the equivalent of $1.59. That ad garnered 26 clicks and 374 
impressions in a single day. Looked at this way, Facebook argument that 50 percent of the ads cost less than 
$3 doesnt sound all that compelling.The ads also represent just a sliver of what the Russian trolls posted on Facebook 
and Instagram. While 3,500 sounds like a sizable number, IRA accounts published some 80,000 organic posts on Facebook and another 
120,000 on Instagram, reaching roughly 146 million Americans between the two.Since these ads ranâ€”and the world found out about itâ€”Facebook 
has announced significant changes that it says could ward off such malicious behavior in the future. In advance of this 
announcement, Facebook sent a bulleted list of these changes to reporters. Going forward, for instance, it requiring all political advertisers, 
including people advertising about hot-button issues such as abortion and gun rights, to provide a copy of their government-issued identification 
and an address to verify that they live in the United States. It will require similar verification for popular pages.The 
company will also begin labeling political ads as such, and, in June, it will launch a repository of political ads 
that includes information on the amount spent on the ad, its reach, and the demographics of the audience it targeted. 
That will eliminate the kind of blind confusion that has ensued over the last year regarding the very ads the 
House made public Thursday. Meanwhile, Facebook will scale its content moderation team to 20,000 people by the end of this 
year.The House Democrats say they plan to eventually publish the organic posts created by the Russian trolls as well. But 
even on its own, Thursday data dump could serve as a useful guide not only for researchers who are still 
mapping out the IRA tactics but also for other tech platformsâ€”like Reddit and Tumblrâ€”that didnt detect Russian trolls until far 
later than their larger counterparts. The goal, after all, is not just to recap what happened but to prevent it 
from happening again.Update: 10:10 am ET 05/10/18 This story has been updated to reflect that after publication, House Democrats revised 
the total number of ads from more than 3,300 to more than 3,500.Bad AdsSpecial counsel Robert Mueller indictment of the 
IRA reads like a sweeping novel of intrigueThe ads that Russian trolls placed on Facebook knew exactly which buttons to

Data: 
	How much do workers at tech firms make?The answer varies a lot, depending on the employer. The median employee 
at Amazon made $28,446 last year, according to new disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. At Facebook, the 
median employee made $240,430, more than eight times as much.There are reasons for the big disparity, of course: Facebookâ€™s 25,000 
employees include many software engineers, which it must recruit in the expensive and competitive San Francisco Bay Area. Most of 
Amazonâ€™s 566,000 employees work in its distribution centers, including many overseas; in the US, Amazon says the average hourly wage 
in its distribution centers is more than $15 an hour, which translates to slightly more than $30,000 a year, before 
overtime.Other disparities reflect differences in companiesâ€™ businesses, and business models. As a car maker, Tesla says 26 percent of its 
employees are production workers and 18 percent are outside the US. The company reported median employee pay of $54,816. Tesla 
says its employees also have benefited from increases in the companyâ€™s share price. IBM, which has aggressively moved jobs overseas 
in recent years, reported median pay of $54,491. The New York Times reported in September that IBM now has more 
employees in India than in the US. An IBM spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Even within the same 
tech sector, median pay can vary significantly based on a companyâ€™s business model. Intel, the largest US maker of semiconductors 
by revenue, makes its own chips. Three of its six manufacturing sites are in the US, as are half of 
its 102,000 employees. The company reported median pay of $102,100. Nvidia, whose graphics chips are used widely for machine learning 
and artificial intelligence, reported median pay of $147,640. The company contracts out the manufacturing of its chips and has only 
about 8,200 employees. A spokesperson says half of Nvidiaâ€™s employees are in the â€œhighly competitiveâ€? Silicon Valley market and that 
its employees are â€œhighly skilled, college educated, and have deep expertiseâ€“all of which command a premium in the market.â€?The median 
pay figures underscore that intense competition for tech talent in the Bay Area. Nationally, the average pay for software developers 
and programmers is $102,470, according to the US Labor Department. Bay Area tech firms are paying considerably more: The median 
pay at Workday, which makes software that helps businesses manage finances and people, is $178,903, according to its proxy statement. 
At Salesforce, another business-software maker, itâ€™s $155,284; and at payments processor Square, itâ€™s $152,265.Companies are disclosing the median pay of 
employees for the first time this year under a new SEC rule intended to shine a light on the high 
pay of CEOs. The rule took effect for fiscal years ending December 31, 2017, or later, so companies on different 
fiscal calendars, including Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, wonâ€™t report their median-pay figures until later this year.Companies have to report the 
ratio of the pay of their CEOs to the median pay of their employees. The Wall Street Journal reported that 
Marathon Petroleum CEO Gary Heminger was paid $19.7 million last year, or 935 times the $21,034 salary of the companyâ€™s 
median worker.The ratios are less meaningful for big tech companies because many of their CEOs are founders who own large 
chunks of the company and receive only nominal compensation. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey received no compensation, according to the companyâ€™s 
proxy statement. Facebookâ€™s Mark Zuckerberg and Google parent Alphabetâ€™s Larry Page each were paid $1. Zuckerbergâ€™s reported compensation also included 
$8.8 million for company-provided security services and travel on company planes. Amazonâ€™s Jeff Bezos was paid a salary of $81,840, 
as he has been annually since 1998; his compensation included $1.6 million for security services paid by the company.Money, Money,

Data: 
	Google wants to help its users take back their time.On Tuesday, at its annual developers conference, the company announced 
several new features designed to help people monitor and manage the time they spend on their devices. The goal: Enable 
users to understand their habits, control the demands technology places on their attention, and focus on what matters. Helping people 
with their digital well-being is more important to us than ever, said vice president of product management Sameer Samat. People 
tell us a lot of the time they spend on their phones is really useful. But some of it they 
wish theyd spent on other things.Or, to use an increasingly prevalent turn of phrase: People want the time on their 
devices to be time well spent. Popularized by Tristan Harris, a former product manager at Google and cofounder of the 
Center for Humane Technology, TWS has snowballed into a movement, reaching acronymic levels of recognition in tech circles and becoming 
a major talking point among the industry biggest companies.But while tech giants may be coming to grips with the disproportionate 
demand technology places on users time and attention, it still not clear how best to confront that imbalance. Much of 
what we know about technology allure is based not on peer-reviewed research but on anecdata. Here what the existing evidence 
has to say about the features Google unveiled this week.Step One: AwarenessGoogle thinks the first step toward reclaiming your time 
involves understanding your habits. On that front, the most comprehensive update is a systemwide tracking feature called Dashboard, which monitors 
at multiple levels howâ€”and how oftenâ€”you use your Android device. It can tell you things like how much time you 
spend on your phone, how much time you spend in specific apps, how often you unlock your phone, and how 
many notifications you receive on a daily basis.At first blush, Dashboard sounds a lot like Moment, a popular screen-time-tracking app 
designed by Kevin Holesh that been available for iOS since 2014. In the past four years, Holesh says he has 
received at least hundreds of emails from users who, upon using the app, discovered they spend twice as much time 
on their devices as they thought they did. (Peer-reviewed research on estimated vs. real-world smartphone use is lacking, but a 
small study published in 2015 found that test subjects, while good at guessing the time they spend on their devices, 
tend to underestimate the number of times they check their phones on a daily basis by more than half.)I asked 
Holesh to scrape some data on his users. Drawing from a randomly selected sample of 100,000 active customers, Holesh found 
that, among those that had downloaded the app and used it to monitor their activity at least 30 days, some 
56 percent had reduced their screen time by an average of 24 minutes.By building screen-tracking directly into its operating system, 
Holesh says, Google is poised to monitor usage patterns better than any third-party app could hope to achieve. Indeed, according 
to Samat, Dashboard will take usage tracking a step further than Moment currently does, by allowing developers to trackâ€”and then 
share with usersâ€”detailed information about how people use their apps.That data could be invaluable to users: Evidence suggests that the 
effects of screen time vary not only between apps but within them. Internal studies at Facebook suggest that people who 
spend time passively consuming information on the platform report feeling worse afterward, while people who spend their time actively engaging 
with other users experienced the opposite effect.The same may also be true of the way people use Twitter. Or Instagram. 
Or Gmail. That where the conversation with technology needs to go, and what Google is trying for here, because not 
all screen time is created equal, says Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist at the Oxford Internet Institute who studies the 
self-regulation of technology use.Step Two: ActionBut understanding your technological habits and taking control of them are two different things, which 
is why Google has paired Dashboard with another tool called App Timer. As its name suggests, the feature allows you 
to set a cap on the time you spend in given apps. Say you want to spend no more than 
30 minutes a day on Twitter. As you near your designated time limit, your phone will remind you that youre 
approaching your cutoff. Exceed your limit, and Twitter app icon will turn to gray on your home screen and, at 
least in the beta version of Android P, Google new mobile operating system, prevent you from opening the app.But these 
cues and roadblocks might have a smaller impact on user behavior than Google hopes. Again, data from Moment is instructive 
here: Recall that screen-time awareness alone led 56 percent of Moment customers to decrease their time on a device by 
an average of 24 minutes per day. Holesh says his app Daily Limit feature seems to only push about 6 
percent more of my customer base towards lowering their daily screen time. (The average decrease among those users is 26 
minutes). The daily limit feature is effective at reducing screen time, but only slightly, and not for a huge part 
of my customer base, Holesh says.In other words: To implement lasting change many people could require more help than an 
app timer.That where Google other updates could come into play. The first is Wind Down, which automatically sets your phone 
to Do Not Disturb and adjusts your display settings at a predesignated time.Like Apple Night Shift and Bed Time features, 
Wind Down is designed to help you get a better night sleep. But whereas iOS pursues this goal by shifting 
the temperature of your display from cool to warm, Android does it by changing your screen from color to grayscale.Which 
approach is better? Hard to say. A handful of studies do suggest that warm tones interfere less with your circadian 
rhythms, and your shut-eye, than cool onesâ€”but similar research is lacking on grayscale displays. Popular among the digital-detox set, a 
grayscale screen is thought to be less distracting than those on a colorful one, and marketing experts will tell you 
that designers have long relied on colors to encourage subconscious decisionmaking. But at least as of this writing, the evidence 
on grayscale screens is limited to conventional wisdom and anecdotes.Two additional updates include Shushâ€”a feature that allows you to set 
your phone to Do Not Disturb simply by flipping it faceside downâ€”and a new batched notifications setting that delivers all 
your YouTube notifications in the form of a once-daily digest. Multiple studies have linked phone alerts to inattention, hyperactivity, and 
anxiety. But the results of these studies are more nuanced than notifications = bad. What they actually show is that 
when and how notifications are delivered has a significant impact on test subjects self-reported well-being.One study led by computer scientist 
Luz Rello, of Carnegie Mellon Human Computer Interaction Institute, found that disabling notifications left some test subjects feeling less stressed 
and more productive during working hours but anxious in their off-time, for fear of missing important information and violating expectations 
of others. Another study presented earlier this year at the American Psychology Association conference of Technology, Mind, and Society found 
that test subjects who received their notifications in batches three times a day reported they felt significantly happier, more focused, 
and less stressed than those who received notifications as usual, or not at all.Too many notifications seemed to result in 
attentional overload. Too few seemed to lead to FOMO, or fear of missing out, says coauthor Kostadin Kushlev, a psychologist 
at the University of Virginia who studies how smartphone use can improve or detract from personal well-being.Essential to the current 
conversation surrounding Time Well Spent, it seems, is finding the balance between FOMO and what Google on Tuesday called JOMO: 
the joy of missing out. Also essential? More research.Overall the steps Google is taking are great, but I would really 
like to see some rigorous investigations that indicate people like the features, use them, and feel empowered by them, Przybylski 
says. Like, an empirical study. Or three. That means open and robust research. Registered, randomized controlled trials. Independent replications. It 
would be good for science and it would be good for the product, Przybylski says.And most of all, good for 
users.More from I/O:Google new features make life easierâ€”and they help the company collect more data on its users.Miss the big

Data: 
	Everyone knows Washington is a swamp filled with snakes and influence peddlers. And few believed President Trump would do 
much to change that, despite his drain the swamp battle cry. In fact, one could argue he has done much 
since taking office to encourage influence peddling.He refused to put his assets in a blind trust or release his tax 
returns. That means he can know which people, businesses, and countries that want something from him as president are also 
supporting him as a businessman. And even though he has said he wont seek that information, the public has no 
way to hold him accountable to that promise. A true cynic might wonder when companies would just start handing Trump 
personal attorney suitcases of cash every time they wanted access, or to know what was on his mind.Thatâ€™s not dark 
comedy anymore. The New York Times and Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for the porn star known as Stormy Daniels, both 
reported yesterday that, starting in 2016 and continuing through January, Michael Cohen, Trump personal attorney, accepted payments totaling more than 
$1.2 million from companies that may have wanted to influence Trump or sought information about Trump thinking. The money was 
paid to the same company, Essential Consultants, from which Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 shortly before the election not to talk 
about her alleged tryst with Trump.In all, Avenatti said, more than $4 million flowed through Essential Consultants from October 2016 
to January 2018. Investigators are trying to understand the motivations behind a $500,000 payment from Columbus Nova, a US investment 
firm with ties to a Russian oligarch connected to Russian president Vladimir Putin, according to the Times. Meanwhile pharmaceutical firm 
Novartis confirmed it paid Essential about $1.2 million and that it had cooperated fully with an inquiry from special counsel 
Robert Muellerâ€™s office. Novartis said it entered into a year-long agreement with Essential in February 2017. After one meeting, the 
company said, it â€œdetermined that Michael Cohen and Essential Consultants would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had 
anticipated,â€? but the company felt obligated to continue the payments under the contract.Of particular note to those in Hollywood and 
Silicon Valley were four payments totaling $200,000 from AT&amp;T to Essential from October 2017 through January 2018.Michael Cohen should not 
be selling access to the president of the United States. This is a big deal, Avenatti said on Anderson Cooper 
360Â° Tuesday night. He said it didnt take too much imagination to wonder whether some of the money paid to 
Cohen ended up in Trump pockets. Neither Trump nor Cohen have commented.USA Today White House correspondent Gregory Korte tweeted Wednesday 
that Cohen and AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson entered Trump Tower eight minutes apart on Jan. 12, 2017, according to a 
pool report at the time. 1https://twitter.com/gregorykorte/status/994253095277391872AT&amp;T had two reasons to be keenly interested in Trump thinking during that period. It, 
along with other wireless and cable companies, was pushing the Federal Communications Commission to end net neutrality, the rules that 
bar telecom companies from blocking or favoring certain content. It also needs government approval of its $85 billion proposed acquisition 
of Time Warner. To be fair, all corporations seek intelligence about the inner workings of new administrations. And corporations needed 
to work harder for intelligence about the basic workings of the Trump White House than with previous administrations, because Trump 
was an outsider surrounded by few of the well-known Washington hands.Asked about the relationship, AT&amp;T was not evasive. Essential Consulting 
was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration, AT&amp;T said 
in a statement Tuesday evening. They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 
2017.If AT&amp;T was looking to buy influence, it has a mixed record. The FCC under Trump appointee Ajit Pai voted 
3â€“2 in December to repeal its 2015 net neutrality rules, freeing telecom firms to create paid â€œfast lanesâ€? for certain 
content, or to exempt certain content from data caps in wireless plans, a concept known as â€œzero rating.â€? The move 
was strongly opposed by most Silicon Valley companies, some of whom are joining a â€œRed Alertâ€? day on the web 
Wednesday to support a congressional move to restore net neutrality.On the Time Warner merger, however, AT&amp;T has had less success. 
The Justice Department in November sued to block the deal as anticompetitive. Testimony in that trial ended last week, and 
the judge is expected to rule next month.1 CORRECTION, 5PM EDT: AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson and Michael Cohen both visited 
Trump Tower on Jan. 12, 2017. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said they both visited the White House.Trump
