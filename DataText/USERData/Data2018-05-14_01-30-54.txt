	Transportation is a world full of visionaries: big ideas gone even bigger. It attracts world shakers (and breakers) like 
Grimesâ€™ Boyfriend, Travis Kalanick, and Mark Moore, a 30-year NASA veteran who decamped last year for Uberâ€™s new flying car 
project. There are lots of fanciful renderings and prototypes, lots of pulled-off covers and pointing of spotlights. But thereâ€™s a 
lot of busted dreams too. Plans that run out of money, petering out and puttering toward death. Collectors who come 
calling. Cars that crash and kill.Which is all to say: It was a mixed bag of a week. Senior writer 
Jack Stewart covered the two-day bonanza that was Uberâ€™s second-annual, and completely serious, flying car summit. Editor Alex Davies took 
a close look at startup Drive.aiâ€™s upcoming self-driving shuttle launch in unlikely Frisco, Texas. Fun stuff! But ugly stuff too: 
Teslaâ€™s investor insurrection, thanks (in part) to Grimesâ€™ Boyfriendâ€™s indelicate earnings call comments. A Waymo crash in Arizona that doesnâ€™t 
appear to have anything to do with self-driving tech but had really unfortunate timing anyway. And a jump in pedestrian 
deathsâ€”which weâ€™ll need much more than autonomous vehicles to prevent.Letâ€™s get you caught up.HeadlinesStories you might have missed from WIRED 
this weekUber wants to play middleman in the flying car future, slinging app-ordered rides that take riders smoothly from A 
to B as the fools in ground-bound vehicles sit in traffic below. But that doesnâ€™t mean it wonâ€™t have a 
hand in the flying car design. This week, the ride-hailing giant turned transportation-everything unveiled an all-electric VTOL concept, and reiterated 
its commitment to an ambitious timeline: commercial flights by 2022.Last weekâ€™s Tesla fireworks continue, with an activist investor now pushing 
the electric carmakerâ€™s shareholders to banish three of its nine board members in favor of folks with relevant manufacturing expertise. 
One way Grimesâ€™ Boyfriend could kill the insurrection? By making more cars.In more Tesla news: The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration clarified that the carmaker, and not the federal agency, came up with a much-cited Autopilot safety statistic. Which meant 
it was a good time for me to ask: How much do we know about Autopilot safety record, anyway?Late last 
week, a Waymo minivan being driven by a human got seriously banged up by an out-of-control Honda driver. Police in 
Chandler, Arizona, determined the Waymo vehicle wasnâ€™t at fault, but the scary photos of the banged-up Chrysler Pacifica were spookily 
reminiscent of this springâ€™s fatal Uber crash.Yeehaw! Alex explores Drive.aiâ€™s plans to launch a self-driving shuttle service in the Lone 
Star State, and why geofenced and limited shuttle routes just might be lots of Americansâ€™ first experiences with autonomous vehicles.Heck 
naw! Contributor Nick Stockton tries to get to the bottom of why Nashville, Tennessee, voters soundly rejected an ambitious transit 
revamp meant to improve transportation in the traffic-choked city.The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released a disturbing study on pedestrian 
deaths, finding fatalities jumped by 46 percent between 2009 and 2016. Some say autonomous vehicles will solve all our road 
safety problems, but the tech has a ways to go. I explore another option: getting much smarter about road design.

Data: 
	No, youâ€™re not imagining things. The timelines for autonomous vehicles keep shifting. Electric carmaker Tesla began selling a $3,000 
â€œfull self-drivingâ€? add-on to its Autopilot feature in 2016â€”everything you need to drive without driving!â€”but still hasnâ€™t turned it on. 
In 2012, Googleâ€™s Sergey Brin said â€œordinary peopleâ€? would have access to self-driving cars by 2017; the company is still 
gearing up for a very limited driverless taxi service this year. Volvo quietly delayed a project that was supposed to 
put 100 Swedish families into autonomous vehicles by 2017.No one wants unready tech on public roads, but for anyone who 
has bought into the technologyâ€™s promise to save lives, the delay is a bummer. To put it very lightly. Almost 
40,000 Americans died on the road last year. And a new study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety finds 
ugly driving trends have hit one group particularly hard: pedestrians. Nearly 6,000 pedestrian died in 2016, a 46 percent jump 
over 2009. And if robots wonâ€™t save the bipeds, who will?Your friendly carbon-based neighborhood traffic engineer canâ€”and they donâ€™t even 
need artificial intelligence or $75,000 laser sensors to do it.â€œIf there is too much emphasis on autonomous vehicles solving the 
problem, when widespread deployability is decades in the future and not next year, I think it increases the temptation to 
hope that the technology is going to save us,â€? says Liisa Ecola, a transportation planner and senior policy analyst with 
the Rand Corporation. â€œTraffic safety is a big problem now and to ignore the things we can do, I think, 
is a disservice to the tens of thousands of people who are killed every year in crashes.â€?So forget robots. Engineers 
and the public officials who dole out their paychecks can start redesigning streets to make them safer. They can zoom 
in on their problem areasâ€”is there a section of road where people keep getting hurt?â€”and start fixing roads today.The IIHS 
study points to the walking pain points, the issues to be solved. Between 2009 and 2016, deaths on arterialsâ€”the high-capacity, 
wide, multilane roads that feed into freeways or highwaysâ€”jumped 67 percent. Deaths at sections of roads that werenâ€™t intersections went 
up 50 percent. Deaths in the dark rose by more than half.The good news is that road engineers have access 
to a suite of â€œtraffic-calmingâ€? measures, which would slow down cars on otherwise fast-paced roads and could prevent many crashes. 
In fact, Scandinavian-inspired Vision Zero programs, which seek to totally eliminate road deaths and have been adopted by hundreds of 
places in the US, lay out basic principles for preventing deaths.Letâ€™s take a particular example of a terrible and tragic 
road death. In March, Arizona resident Elaine Herzberg died when she was struck by a self-driving Uber on a wide, 
multilane road in Tempe, Arizona. The crash made clear the fallibility not just of robotsâ€”we dont know why the Uber 
didnâ€™t hit the brakes or swerveâ€”but of humans. The Uber employee sitting behind the wheel, charged with grabbing the wheel 
to prevent crashes, was looking away from the road when the SUV hit Herzberg.A better robot could have saved Herzbergâ€™s 
life, but so might have better road design. Tempe is pretty typical for a middling-density place. Engineers built its arterials 
to transport cars, and quickly. Their long, straight lines are easy for drivers to navigate but induce a slow, lazy 
â€œzoning out,â€? and a level of comfort that makes it easier to glance away from the road.Deaths like Herzebergâ€™s, on 
streets like Tempeâ€™s, might have been prevented with more frequent and shorter crosswalks. Herzberg, wheeling a bicycle weighed down with 
plastic bags, was about 100 yards from the nearest crosswalk when she died. Thatâ€™s not too far, but given how 
many crosswalks on urban arterials are miles away from each other, itâ€™s not hard to comprehend why a walker like 
Herzberg might risk a run across the road.Another option is to put a street on what engineers call a â€œroad 
diet,â€? narrowing or even eliminating lanes of traffic. Reducing the margin of error makes drivers more likely to pay attentionâ€”research 
evaluated by the Federal Highway Administration suggests road diets can cut crashes by more than 30 percent, and pedestrian deaths 
or injuries by more than 20.Safety-minded engineers suggest that even simply adding trees or landscaping to the sides of roads 
adds eye-catching elements that can force drivers to focus. Things like â€œbulb outs,â€? which jut into the street at intersections 
and shorten distances between corners for pedestrians, work too. Any way engineers can get drivers to slow the heck down 
is helpful. The faster a car is moving, the more likely it is to kill someone in a collision. Youâ€™re 
as much as 5.5 times more likely to kill someone hitting them at 40 mph than 30 mph.(Oh, and drive 
smaller cars too. The IIHS study notes a spike in deaths among those hit by the larger trucks and SUVs 
Americans cannot stop buying.)Implementing these fixes should be far easier than teaching a robot to interpret a traffic copâ€™s hand 
signals. Most transportation engineers now joining the workforce should be well-acquainted with these strategies, and ready to emphasize safety over 
speed. And compared to the economic impact of crashesâ€”not to mention the loss of livesâ€”Vision Zeroâ€“type interventions cost pennies.But thatâ€™s 
not always the way it turns out in city hall. Infrastructure funding is scarce. Drivers can get hostile when you 
suggest slowing their commutes for the sake of, well, anything. And scientists are still struggling to pin rising pedestrian deaths 
on any one factor. â€œTraffic safety is really a very multidisciplinary problem,â€? says Ecola. â€œItâ€™s not something we can fix 
just with engineering solutions or just with campaigns to get people to wear their seatbelts more often. Itâ€™s all of 
those things.â€?Still, if tragic crashes donâ€™t get politiciansâ€™ attention, what will? Hopefully not just the robo-cars that always seem a 
horizon away.On the Road AgainUber makes peace with cities by spilling its secretsWhy traffic-choked Nashville said nope to public transitA

Data: 
	How much do workers at tech firms make?The answer varies a lot, depending on the employer. The median employee 
at Amazon made $28,446 last year, according to new disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. At Facebook, the 
median employee made $240,430, more than eight times as much.There are reasons for the big disparity, of course: Facebookâ€™s 25,000 
employees include many software engineers, which it must recruit in the expensive and competitive San Francisco Bay Area. Most of 
Amazonâ€™s 566,000 employees work in its distribution centers, including many overseas; in the US, Amazon says the average hourly wage 
in its distribution centers is more than $15 an hour, which translates to slightly more than $30,000 a year, before 
overtime.Other disparities reflect differences in companiesâ€™ businesses, and business models. As a car maker, Tesla says 26 percent of its 
employees are production workers and 18 percent are outside the US. The company reported median employee pay of $54,816. Tesla 
says its employees also have benefited from increases in the companyâ€™s share price. IBM, which has aggressively moved jobs overseas 
in recent years, reported median pay of $54,491. The New York Times reported in September that IBM now has more 
employees in India than in the US. An IBM spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Even within the same 
tech sector, median pay can vary significantly based on a companyâ€™s business model. Intel, the largest US maker of semiconductors 
by revenue, makes its own chips. Three of its six manufacturing sites are in the US, as are half of 
its 102,000 employees. The company reported median pay of $102,100. Nvidia, whose graphics chips are used widely for machine learning 
and artificial intelligence, reported median pay of $147,640. The company contracts out the manufacturing of its chips and has only 
about 8,200 employees. A spokesperson says half of Nvidiaâ€™s employees are in the â€œhighly competitiveâ€? Silicon Valley market and that 
its employees are â€œhighly skilled, college educated, and have deep expertiseâ€“all of which command a premium in the market.â€?The median 
pay figures underscore that intense competition for tech talent in the Bay Area. Nationally, the average pay for software developers 
and programmers is $102,470, according to the US Labor Department. Bay Area tech firms are paying considerably more: The median 
pay at Workday, which makes software that helps businesses manage finances and people, is $178,903, according to its proxy statement. 
At Salesforce, another business-software maker, itâ€™s $155,284; and at payments processor Square, itâ€™s $152,265.Companies are disclosing the median pay of 
employees for the first time this year under a new SEC rule intended to shine a light on the high 
pay of CEOs. The rule took effect for fiscal years ending December 31, 2017, or later, so companies on different 
fiscal calendars, including Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, wonâ€™t report their median-pay figures until later this year.Companies have to report the 
ratio of the pay of their CEOs to the median pay of their employees. The Wall Street Journal reported that 
Marathon Petroleum CEO Gary Heminger was paid $19.7 million last year, or 935 times the $21,034 salary of the companyâ€™s 
median worker.The ratios are less meaningful for big tech companies because many of their CEOs are founders who own large 
chunks of the company and receive only nominal compensation. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey received no compensation, according to the companyâ€™s 
proxy statement. Facebookâ€™s Mark Zuckerberg and Google parent Alphabetâ€™s Larry Page each were paid $1. Zuckerbergâ€™s reported compensation also included 
$8.8 million for company-provided security services and travel on company planes. Amazonâ€™s Jeff Bezos was paid a salary of $81,840, 
as he has been annually since 1998; his compensation included $1.6 million for security services paid by the company.Money, Money,

Data: 
	Update: SpaceX scrubbed Thursday launch after an abort during the countdown sequence. The next window opened Friday at 4:14pm 
Eastern. The Falcon 9 successfully launched and its first stage landed on the drone ship off the coast of Florida, 
which marks the company 25th landing.SpaceX is set to launch the Block 5 version of its flagship rocket, the Falcon 
9, at 4:12 pm Eastern on Thursday, an event that signals that reusable rockets are here to stayâ€”or, rather, to 
boldly go. This upgraded version of the Falcon is expected to launch, land, and re-launch multiple times with little down 
time in between flights.Today mission marks the first time SpaceX has returned to Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center following 
the epic maiden flight of its massive rocket, the Falcon Heavy. That highly anticipated launch captivated crowds across the world 
on February 6, as it ascended through the atmosphere, carrying Elon Muskâ€™s cherry red Tesla roadster (and a dummy driver, 
Starman) into space.LoadingView on InstagramNow, SpaceX will make its long-awaited transition to the Block 5â€”which may not look incredibly different 
than previous versions, but packs a much bigger punch: 1.8 million pounds of thrust, which amounts to a 7 percent 
increase in power. The rocket will lift off sometime during a planned two-hour and 25-minute window and ferry the Bangabandhu-1 
satellite to space. Then the first stage booster will return to Earth, where itâ€™ll try to stick a landing on 
the company drone ship, Of Course I Still Love You, waiting in the Atlantic Ocean.(The nearly 8,000-pound Bangabandhu-1 satellite will 
bring commercial communications capabilities to a rural region of Asia for up to 15 years after being placed into orbit. 
Itâ€™s the first satellite for Bangladesh, making it the 58th country to operate its own satellite in geostationary orbit.)Amy ThompsonSpaceXâ€™s 
philosophy has always been that a fully (and rapidly) reusable rocket is the key to dramatically reducing the cost of 
spaceflight. Currently, a Falcon 9 rocket costs around $62 million, and while SpaceX is currently successfully reusing first-stage boostersâ€”the most 
expensive portion of the rocketâ€”Elon Musk would like to get to the point where much more is reused, essentially ensuring 
that fuel becomes the only major expense. To that end, SpaceX is also attempting to recover and reuse the payload 
fairingsâ€”the protective nose cone that shields the rocketâ€™s cargo as it travels through the atmosphereâ€”with the help of a new 
West Coast based recovery vehicle dubbed Mr. Steven.The vessel, outfitted with a claw-like catcherâ€™s mitt was first employed earlier this 
year during a mission to launch the Paz satellite. The fairing is an expensive piece of hardware, which historically has 
been discarded, costs about 10 percent of the overall price tag of the Falcon 9, so being able to recover 
and reuse it would be a win for SpaceX. Currently, after separation from the rocketâ€™s upper stage, the two halves 
of the fairing navigate back to Earth before a parachute deploys and they land in the ocean.So far Mr. Steven 
has been unsuccessful in its attempts to snag the fairings, but SpaceX gathers data from each attempt, and will ideally 
make a successful catch in the near future.The previous version of the Falcon 9, dubbed the full thrust variant, was 
only capable of flying two or three times at most. If SpaceX is to meet its ultimate goal of flying 
daily, a rocket that can only fly twice is not practical. Hereâ€™s where the Block 5 is crucial.The Block 5, 
a culmination of more than 10 years of development, marks the final design iteration for the Falcon 9 and will 
be the version the company relies on as its workhorse for the foreseeable future. It designed to re-fly as soon 
as 48 hours after landingâ€”a dramatic reduction in the downtime SpaceX rockets currently require.The Block 5 accomplishes this thanks to 
a set of upgrades including improved engines, a more durable interstage, titanium grid fins, and an improved thermal protection system, 
which hold up better to the stresses of launch. And gone are the days of the all-white Falconâ€”the spiffy new 
interstage, along with a set of new, retractable landing legs are painted black. According to SpaceX, the Block 5 is 
capable of flying 10 times or more, needing only light refurbishments, and up to 100 times before the booster is 
retired.SpaceX plans to use the Block 5 to launch astronauts to the space station as early as 2019. In order 
to achieve that goal, it has to fly the Block 5 at least seven times without making any alterations to 
the design, and there are around 20 launches left on the schedule this year. This is shaping up to be 
one slick-looking space taxi.3, 2, 1, Blastoff: More Rocket LaunchesWhy NASAs latest Mars mission launched from CaliforniaPHOTO ESSAY: Behind the

Data: 
	For a company working its way into an industry that specializes in annihilating newcomers, Tesla has proven remarkably persistent. 
It has dodged bankruptcy, built an enormous fan base, and rolled out a series of terrific automobiles that made electric 
cars cool. But the secret to the companyâ€™s endurance is that someone up there likes itâ€”up there being top floor 
corner offices occupied by the investors who have kept Tesla running through 15 profitless years.Now that Tesla is facing a 
series of crisesâ€”a variety of lawsuits, interrogations over the safety of its Autopilot feature, and, most of all, lagging Model 
3 productionâ€”some of those up on high are revealing themselves as Old Testamentâ€“style gods: displeased with what they see happening 
on the ground, and ready to smite.This morning, an activist investor published a letter calling for Tesla shareholders to kick 
three of its nine board members off the board and replace them with people with more relevant experience who will 
be less likely to defer to defiant demigod CEO Elon Musk.The problem is the reality is starting to stack up, 
and thatâ€™s a reality of accidents the cars have had, quality issues, and massive misses on Model 3 production numbers,â€? 
writes that investor, Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW investment group. â€œYou add all that up and thereâ€™s a 
real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.Now that Tesla is mass producing cars, running an energy 
business, and has some 40,000 employees, Waizenegger says it needs board members with experience in manufacturing, utilities, and management, and 
whoâ€™ll be willing to help Musk through various hiccups. â€œThey need to change the composition of the board to reflect 
the evolving business strategy,â€? he says. Tesla expanded its board last year, adding 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch and 
Johnson Publishing Company CEO Linda Johnson Riceâ€”hardly the expertise Waizenegger hoped for, he says. â€œWe needed to do something more 
dramatic.â€?Muskâ€™s refusal to answer analyst queries about Model 3 orders and capital requirements during an investor call last month (he 
dismissed them as â€œboring, bonehead questionsâ€?) didnâ€™t assuage any concerns. â€œWe want the company to survive,â€? Waizenegger says. â€œIt is 
therefore concerning if youâ€™re not able to have a serious conversation with analysts.â€?So, at Teslaâ€™s annual meeting on June 5, 
CtW wants its fellow shareholders to vote against the reelection to the board of venture capitalist Antonio Gracias, Elonâ€™s brother 
Kimbal Musk, and Murdoch. (Like in the Senate, only third of Tesla board members come up for reelection at a 
time.) Itâ€™s another way of saying: Musk should keep the top spot, but he needs more oversight. Tesla declined to 
comment.Waizenegger has long voiced his concerns about Teslaâ€™s board, which has hardly changed since the company went public in 2010, 
and most of whose members have close personal ties to Musk.CtW may be right, but that doesnâ€™t make it mighty. 
And volubility does not mean anybody will join the cause. The firm, which runs pension funds sponsored by Change to 
Win, a federation of unions, holds about 260,000 Tesla shares. By comparison, the automakerâ€™s largest shareholder, Fidelity, holds more than 
16 million. And despite Muskâ€™s concerning performance on that investor call, Tesla seems to be headed in the right direction, 
saying it should hit its target of building 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week in the next few months, and 
reach profitability soon after. Just the sort of thing that should soothe anxious investors.â€œIâ€™m betting almost all of these problems 
would be fine if Model 3 production went to 5,000 plus, starting relatively soon,â€? says Karl Brauer, an auto industry 
analyst with Kelley Blue Book. â€œYou can point to plenty of automakers that have had plenty of controversial issues crop 
up. But if theyâ€™re overall profitable, people rightly assume theyâ€™ll get through it.â€?Waizenegger maintains that experienced board members willing to 
help Musk manage the company are crucial to Teslaâ€™s future. The automaker is in a particularly tough spot right now, 
fighting a series of crises as it tries to roll out the Model 3, the car thatâ€™s supposed to bring 
electric driving to the masses and profits to investors. So the doubters may be more numerous and audible than usual. 
But if Musk has proven anything, itâ€™s that he can sell people on a vision and deliverâ€”even if it takes 
a Hail Mary.All About ElonTesla favorite Autopilot safety stat just doesnt stand upMusk ire reveals a Wall Street-Silicon Valley divideTesla

	In the evolving geographic distribution of self-driving cars, the go-to getaway is Arizona, where good weather and minimal government 
interference make testing two-ton robots something like fun in the sun. But as with all such places, the more crowded 
it gets, the less people want to go there any more. Maybe thatâ€™s why Mountain Viewâ€“based startup Drive.ai isnâ€™t taking 
its robo-cars to the land of the Grand Canyon, but to the wilds of the Lone Star State.Starting in July, 
the company will run a fleet of driverless vehicles around Frisco, Texas, a city of 164,000 people on the northern 
edge of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area. Announced today, the six-month pilotâ€”which will keep human safety operators behind the wheel, 
ready to grab control if the car gets confused or misbehavesâ€”marks Drive.aiâ€™s first large-scale effort to put people in its 
cars, and the first such deployment in Texas. Waymo has done some testing in Austin, but this service will provide 
regular rides to the public.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Self-Driving CarsThe Drive.ai setup will look like more like an airport 
shuttle than a taxi service. The companyâ€™s easily recognizable orange and blue Nissan NV200 vans will run only in a 
tightly geofenced area, along fixed routes.Drive.ai hasnâ€™t divulged much in the way of details, but says one such route will 
serve employees at an office park in the southern bit of the city, taking them between buildings and to a 
nearby stadium and apartment complex, at no charge. It will use fixed pickup and drop-off locations, so the cars donâ€™t 
have to worry about finding a safe space to pull over.â€œBy choosing geofenced regions and working with partners, we can 
take advantage of self-driving carsâ€™ strengths while diminishing their weaknesses,â€? says Andrew Ng, a member of Drive.aiâ€™s board, and a 
leading artificial intelligence expert.For the foreseeable future, this is how everyone will manage their fleets. Making a car that can 
handle any conceivable situation is just too hard; the world is too complex. By limiting a vehicle to fixed routes, 
or at least a limited area, you can be sure youâ€™ve got fully updated maps, you can keep track of 
conditions like construction that might make things tricky, and you can stick to the simplest situations. As your technology proves 
itself and everyone starts to feel more confident, you can expand.Drive.ais vans will use exterior screens to communicate with people 
on the street.Drive.aiIndeed, in later stages of this project, Drive.ai hopes to dump the human backup driver and fill the 
passenger seat with a human â€œchaperone,â€? to help guide passengers through the service. And, like just about every company working 
on autonomous operations, it will have ready-to-help humans sitting in a remote location, monitoring the vehicles and issuing instructions as 
needed.Drive.ai stands out among the host of companies in this space for its consideration of how its vehicles talk to 
the world around them. Because, when you put a computer in charge, you lose the human ability to wave a 
pedestrian ahead, or make the eye contact that lets that cyclist know you see her.â€œWe need to be able to 
communicate in all directions, and we need to be able to show intention and have a conversation with the other 
players on the road,â€? Drive.ai co-founder and president Carol Reiley told WIRED back in 2016, when the company was starting 
to test with roof-mounted â€œbillboardsâ€? that could display messages. For the Frisco pilot, the Nissan vans will have panels mounted 
on all sides to say things like â€œWaiting for you to cross,â€? â€œpulling over,â€? and â€œpassengers entering.â€?And now, maybe, â€œWelcome 
to Texas, home of the robo-revolution.â€?Robo-RevolutionSelf-driving cars have a secret weapon: humans in call centersTesla favorite Autopilot safety stat just

Data: 
	Wall Street and Silicon Valley have never been happy bedfellows, and that was on full display this week during 
Teslaâ€™s quarterly earnings call. These calls are usually dull affairs, with CEOs or CFOs reading a prepared script summarizing the 
already-released financial results and articulating the main goals of the company that have, presumably, been stated before. Then Wall Street 
analysts ask a series of questions about the results, tactics, and strategy that executives artfully dodge or dutifully answer. Much 
like press conferences, the format does not lend itself to spontaneity.WIRED OpinionAboutZachary Karabell is a WIRED Contributor. Karabell is the 
head of Global Strategies Envestnet and the president of River Twice Research.Except when the company is Tesla and the CEO 
is Elon Musk. The press after this weekâ€™s call was intensely critical of Musk for dismissing questions, refusing to delve 
into financial details, and musing about robo-Ubers and autonomous electric trucks cutting into rail transport. More than most, the call 
exposed the starkly different perspectives of Wall Street and the valley. Musk clearly is avoiding some hard questions about Teslaâ€™s 
financial viability. But itâ€™s equally true that the call exposed how limited Wall Street can be about visions for the 
future and what it takes to create new templates for doing old things.Musk is not your normal CEO, of course, 
with his multiple interlocking companies and his abilityâ€”so farâ€”to convince investors to go along for a ride that promises the 
moon (or Mars in the case of his SpaceX) and delivers no earnings while taking on huge amounts of debt. 
But even by those standards, his refusal to answer basic questions about, say, how much cash Tesla is burning through 
and whether the company has a plan to continue subsidizing and capitalizing its expenses struck Wall Street as odd and 
a sign of deep problems.What made this call peculiar was the way Musk dismissed sober questions by respected Wall Street 
analysts such as Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein, who pressed Musk about costs and cash. Musk brushed him off, sniping that 
â€œbonehead, boring questions are not cool.â€? To add insult to that injury, Musk then fielded questions from a YouTube user, 
who proceeded to dominate a call normally open only to significant Wall Street analysts. That did not sit well with 
the Street, and Sacconaghi lambasted Musk the next day on CNBC with the rather clever jab, â€œThis is a financial 
analyst call, this is not a TED talk.â€? Friday, Musk returned fire, with tweets asserting that the question was boneheaded 
because the analyst already knew the answer and was asking purely to advocate a negative thesis about the company.Muskâ€™s sparring 
with analysts recalls similar tensions between Wall Street analysts and Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Reed Hastings of Netflix, Mark Zuckerberg 
of Facebook and other arrogant, aggressive, and visionary technology CEOs. The analysts consistently press for metrics including revenue, margins, cash 
burn, and earnings projections. The CEOs routinely try to emphasize growth, users, experience, and long-term vision. The analysts press on 
expenses, competitors, cost of capital; the CEOs dodge and weave and point to strategy, new models, breaking old molds, and 
creating new marketplaces. And so the dance goes.The power has shifted back and forth since the real explosion of tech 
companies on Wall Street during the 1990s. During the dot-com euphoria of the late 1990s, the concerns of traditional Wall 
Street analysts were seen as quaint, stodgy, and hopelessly backward. Who cares about traditionally viable business models, the techies essentially 
said; we are creating entirely new channels. After the Nasdaq bubble burst in 2000, the momentum shifted to Wall Street; 
actually, cash matters, and having a real business with real revenue has to be part of the equation sooner rather 
than later. In recent years, there has been more convergence, with a handful of tech companies growing into potent businesses 
respected by Wall Street and attracting massive investor interest.The Tesla conundrum again crystallizes this conflict. Analysts demand a sense of 
when, and how, the company will generate cash and stop accumulating debt; Musk finds such concerns secondary to building out 
an ecosystem of battery production, propulsion and motor systems, renewable-powered robotic factories, and new modes of production meant to revolutionize 
how heavy stuff is made as surely as Henry Ford and Frederick Winslow Taylor did in the early 20th century.Ideally, 
one wouldnâ€™t pick sides. After all, even Musk knows that at some point, his businesses will have to generate earnings 
and cash. Debt, however raised, isnâ€™t endlessâ€”unless you are a sovereign government. But he also believes that unless the entire 
ecosystem is built out, it will fail. Hence the focus on massive capital spending and plowing into new business lines. 
Bezos had a similar ethos with Amazon, and essentially told Wall Street that he was going to follow his own 
vision and that investors were welcome to come along for the ride but not to drive. Those investors have been 
rewarded and then some. Of course, investors in Jawbone and Webvan were also promised transformation and ended up with nothing.Musk 
is telling investors that they can choose whether to buy in to his vision, but that they canâ€™t challenge it. 
Given that almost no one in the analyst and investor community has ever built or run a mold-breaking business, telling 
them that they can accept or reject the vision isnâ€™t unreasonable.Wall Street is often extremely good at what it does. 
Bankers and analysts understand how to price debt and equities while assessing the potential of loss, which they do diligently 
and conservatively (except when they fail spectacularly). But Wall Street is not, for the most part, the playground of those 
who define the future. That requires tolerating extreme risk and conceiving how things could be done differently. Most visionaries will 
be utterly wrong about their vision, because they are early, or overreach, or miscalculate. Buying Tesla stock is immensely risky, 
perhaps even ill-advised. That does not mean Musk should alter what he does or how he does it. In fact, 
managing his enterprises to please Wall Street is an almost certain path to failure; the numbers donâ€™t add upâ€”and wonâ€™tâ€”unless 
everything works almost perfectly. Whether you go along for the investing ride is up to you, but Teslaâ€™s fate should 
not be up to Wall Street analysts.Baby You Can Drive My CarWith his recent outburst, has Elon Musk gone from

	What do you think about Elon Musk? Tell me and Iâ€™ll know a lot about your attitudes toward, well, 
most things. Take this weekâ€™s first quarter earnings call. Executives at your average carmakerâ€”your average public company, evenâ€”would bore to 
numbness all but the most invested investors. But Elon has no time for â€œboring, boneheadâ€? calls. So he got rather 
saucy on his, cutting off those tedious penny pinchers. Either you see him as a maverickâ€”a boy gone delightfully big 
money, saving the world as he swingsâ€”or as an irresponsible leader who sent his companyâ€™s stock (which, reminder, many of 
his employees own) shuddering down the y-axis.No matter what you think of Musk, it was his week. Transportation editor Alex 
Davies tackled what Teslaâ€™s first quarter numbers and that exceedingly interesting earnings call means for the electric carmaker. Meanwhile, senior

behind. Thatâ€™s an impressive milestone with an unfortunate side effect: The carmakers will lose access to the federal governmentâ€™s $7,500 
purchase credit. Jack explores the strategy around selling EVs in a slightly more expensive world.The doom and gloom crowd had 
predicted dismal first quarter numbers from Tesla. But when the electric carmaker released its figures on Wednesday, they contained a 
bit of a surprise: production is up, and profitability might be in sight. The company just has to stick to 
the scheduleâ€”and defy history doing it.Then Elon got on the phone and mucked it up a bit, cutting off â€œdryâ€? 
analyst questions in favor of expansive, future-looking queries. You know, the fun stuff. The stock market was displeased, and Alex 
wondered whether the 46-year-old boy wonder is becoming more liability than asset.Musk isnâ€™t the only auto head prepping for the 
future. Contributor Nicholas Stecher spoke to Wilko Stark, the guy in charge of Daimlerâ€™s connected, autonomous, shared, and electric strategies. 
One big takeaway: the company that owns Mercedes-Benz ainâ€™t scared of Waymo, Apple, or Uber.Business reporter Klint Finley takes a 
close look at what could be a game-changing ruling by the California Supreme Court, which found one companyâ€™s drivers are 
in fact employees. Thatâ€™s a bad precedent for Uber, Lyft, and the rest of the gig economy.If your vision of 
the future of cars doesnâ€™t involve cars at all, some excellent newsâ€”people are definitely still working on ways to get 
you around the city. I explore the Los Angeles Metroâ€™s pathbreaking approach to collaborate with the private sector (there might

Data: 
	For more than a year, Tesla has defended its semiautonomous Autopilot as a vital, life-saving feature. CEO Elon Musk 
has lambasted journalists who write about crashes involving the system. â€œIt really incredibly irresponsible of any journalists with integrity to 
write an article that would lead people to believe that autonomy is less safe,â€? he said during a tumultuous earnings 
call this week. â€œBecause people might actually turn it off, and then die.â€?This wasnâ€™t the first time Musk has made 
this argument about Autopilot, which keeps the car in its lane and a safe distance from other vehicles but requires 
constant human oversight, and has been involved in two fatal crashes in the US. â€œWriting an article thatâ€™s negative, youâ€™re 
effectively dissuading people from using autonomous vehicles, youâ€™re killing people,â€? he said on an October 2016 conference call.Wednesdayâ€™s haranguing, however, 
came a few hours after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) indicated that Tesla has been misconstruing the key 
statistic it uses to defend its technology. Over the past year and a half, Tesla spokespeople have repeatedly said that 
the agency has found Autopilot to reduce crash rates by 40 percent. They repeated it most recently after the death 
of a Northern California man whose Model X crashed into a highway safety barrier while in Autopilot mode in March.Now 
NHTSA says thatâ€™s not exactly rightâ€”and thereâ€™s no clear evidence for how safe the pseudo-self-driving feature actually is.LEARN MOREThe WIRED 
Guide to Self-Driving CarsThe remarkable stat comes from a January 2017 report that summarized NHTSAâ€™s investigation into the death of 
Joshua Brown, whose Model S crashed into a truck turning across its path while in Autopilot mode. According to its 
data, model year 2014 through 2016 Teslas saw 1.3 airbag deployments per million miles, before Tesla made Autopilot available via 
an over-the-air software update. Afterward, the rate was 0.8 per million miles. â€œThe data show that the Tesla vehicles crash 
rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation,â€? the investigators concluded.Just a few problems. First, as reported by Reuters 
and confirmed to WIRED, NHTSA has reiterated that its data came from Tesla, and has not been verified by an 
independent party (as it noted in a footnote in the report). Second, it says its investigators did not consider whether 
the driver was using Autopilot at the time of each crash. (Reminder: Drivers are only supposed to use Autopilot in 
very specific contexts.) And third, airbag deployments are an inexact proxy for crashes. Especially considering that in the death that 
triggered the investigation, the airbags did not deploy.Tesla declined to comment on NHTSAâ€™s clarification.The statistic has been the subject of 
controversy for some time. The research firm Quality Control Systems Corp. has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against 
NHTSA for the underlying data in that 2017 report, which it hopes to use to determine whether the 40 percent 
figure is valid. NHTSA has thus far denied its FOIA requests, saying it agreed to Teslaâ€™s requests to keep the 
data confidential, and that its release could threaten the carmakersâ€™ competitiveness.Teslaâ€™s oft-touted figure is flawed for another reason, experts say: 
With this data set, you canâ€™t separate the role of Autopilot from that of automatic emergency braking, which Tesla began 
releasing just a few months before Autopilot. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, vehicles that can detect imminent 
collisions and hit the brakes on their own suffer half as many rear-end crashes as those that canâ€™t. (More than 
99 percent of cars Tesla produced in 2017 came equipped with the feature standard, a higher proportion than any other 
carmaker.)Which is all to say, determining whether a new feature like Autopilot is safe, especially if you donâ€™t have access 
to lots of replicable, third-party data, is super, super hard. Teslaâ€™s beloved 40 percent figure comes with so many caveats, 
itâ€™s unreliable.Big Deal DataThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has tried to come at the question another way, by looking 
at the frequency of insurance claims. When it tried to separate Model S sedan incidents after Autopilot was released, it 
observed no changes in the frequency of property damage and bodily injury liability claims. That indicates that Autopilot drivers arenâ€™t 
more or less less likely to damage their cars or get hurt than others. But it did find a 13 
percent reduction in collision claim frequency, indicating sedans with Autopilot enabled got into fewer crashes that resulted in collision claims 
to insurers.Oh, but it gets more complicated. IIHS couldnâ€™t tell which crashes actually involved the use Autopilot, and not just 
sedans equipped with Autopilot. And itâ€™s way too early for definitive answers. â€œSince other safety technologies are layered below Autopilot, 
it is difficult to tease out results for Autopilot alone at this time,â€? says Russ Rader, an IIHS spokesperson. â€œData 
on insurance claims for the Model S are still thin.â€?Over at MIT, researchers frustrated with the dearth of good info 
on Autopilot and other semiautonomous car features have launched their own lines of inquiry. Human guinea pigs are now driving 
sensor- and camera-laden Teslas, Volvos, and Range Rovers around the Boston area. The researchers will use the data they generate 
to understand how safely humans operate those vehicles.The upshot is that Autopilot might, in fact, be saving a ton of 
lives. Or maybe not. We just donâ€™t know. And Tesla hasnâ€™t been transparent with its own numbers. â€œYou would need 
a rigorous statistical analysis with clear data indicating what vehicle has it and what vehicle doesnâ€™t and whether itâ€™s enabled 
or whether it isnâ€™t,â€? says David Friedman, a former NHTSA official who now directs car policy at Consumers Union. Tesla 
said this week that it would begin publishing quarterly Autopilot safety statistics, but did not indicate whether its data would 
be verified by a third party.NHTSA, too, could be doing a better at holding innovative but opaque carmakers like Tesla 
accountable for proving the safety of their new tech. â€œTo me, they should be more transparent by asking Tesla for 
disengagements of the system: How often the systems disengaged, how often the humans need to take over,â€? Friedman says. Californiaâ€™s 
Department of Motor Vehicles requires companies testing autonomous vehicles in the state to provide annual data on disengagements, to help 
officials understand the limitations of the tech and its progress.Tesla is not alone among carmakers in trying to shield sensitive 
info from the public. But today, humans are deeply bewildered about the semiautonomous features that have already made their way 
into everyday driversâ€™ garages. Even Transportation Secretary Elaine Chaoâ€”you know, the public official charged with overseeing regulation on these thingsâ€”is 
confused by the terminology. If thereâ€™s a time to get honest about your numbers, this could be it. You might 
save some lives. Youâ€™d definitely save a few headaches.Tesla TurmoilElon Musk attack on investors could make him a liabilityBuying a

Data: 
	The numbers, arranged on the paper like tea leaves in the fortune-tellerâ€™s cup, heralded a sunny future. Production rates 
up. Market share impressive. Profitability in sight. Tesla had work left to do, but it was moving in the right 
direction, and fast enough to assuage investors wondering when the young automaker would reel in its spending and find its 
way into the black.Then Elon Musk took charge of his own fate. In a public earnings call with investors and 
financial analysts Wednesday afternoon, the CEO attacked two analysts for asking what he called â€œboneheadâ€? and â€œdryâ€? questions, and refused 
to offer answers. By the morning, Teslaâ€™s stock had dropped nearly 10 percent.And so the question becomes unavoidable. Has Musk, 
with his inimitable Ã©lon, gone from asset to liability?Itâ€™s a remarkable turn for a man who stands out, even in 
this age of Silicon Valley leader worship, for his inextricable association with his company. He has never been a conventional 
CEO, and thatâ€™s been more feature than bug over the past decade. He tweets about building cyborg dragons, jokes about 
bankruptcy and mixing Ambien with red wine, and appears on talk shows and Page 6. He has launched Big Fucking 
Rockets, promised traffic-obliterating mazes of tunnels, and conjured a hyperloop industry from nothing. He made electric cars really, really cool. 
After his legions of fans bought 50,000 Boring Company hats for $20 a piece, Musk moved on to $500 flamethrowers. 
He sold 20,000 in under a week.No wonder: Musk is the entrepreneur who ignores conventional wisdom, who silences haters and 
doubters with acceleration records and cars rocketing around the solar system. He attacks the media and fights federal investigators. Itâ€™s 
all part of a hugely popular personal brand that canâ€™t be separated from Teslaâ€™s knack for surviving in an industry 
that kills just about all newcomers. Even when it delivers cars years behind schedule, when executives flee and scandals stack 
up, Muskâ€™s fans remain zealous, and his investors indulgent. Indeed, in March, a large majority of Tesla shareholders approved a 
compensation package that could make Musk $55 billion if he delivers on extraordinary goals, and that effectively locks him in 
the job for the next decade. (Musk discussed the idea of leaving Tesla in 2013, but now says heâ€™s there 
for the long haul.)The read-through is that potentially the CEO doesnâ€™t care or isnâ€™t focused about those financial metrics or 
ultimately the numbers donâ€™t tell a good story.Now, though, Musk has mocked some of the people who are most vital 
to Teslaâ€™s survivalâ€”the investors who have pushed it to valuation that surpasses Fordâ€™sâ€”and paid a price. Wednesdayâ€™s call went south 
when analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein asked about Teslaâ€™s ability to reach a gross margin target of 25 
percent on the Model 3, then about its projected capital requirements. â€œExcuse me,â€? Musk interrupted. â€œNext. Boring bonehead questions are 
not cool. Next?â€?Then came Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets, who asked how many Model 3 reservation holders are actually 
buying the car. â€œSorry. These questions are so dry. Theyre killing me,â€? Musk saidâ€”after 10 seconds of silence. As Musk 
turned to take a long series of questions from a YouTube financial blogger (some of them pointed), the stock started 
dropping in after hours trading, ending up down close to 10 percent.Teslaâ€™s stock has always been volatile, subject to vertigo-inducing 
spikes and dives. On that serrated line, this drop doesnâ€™t stand out for its size. What sets it apart is 
the trigger. Teslaâ€™s quarterly numbers were quite solid. Perhaps truthful, detailed answers to Sacconaghi and Spakâ€™s questions would have been 
unpleasant. But where the conventional CEO might dance around bad news, or hide it in a wooly nest of jargon 
and non-answers, Musk attacked. And he made himself look bad.â€œInvestor feedback to the call was shock that a CEO would 
be dismissive and the general sentiment was that the defensiveness spoke volumes,â€? Spak wrote in a note summarizing the call 
and financial results.â€œThere is incremental concern when, on an analyst financial quarterly call, the CEO doesnâ€™t appear to want to 
talk about important financial metrics,â€? Sacconaghi, the other spurned analyst, said on Bloomberg Television. â€œThe read-through is that potentially the 
CEO doesnâ€™t care or isnâ€™t focused about those financial metrics or ultimately the numbers donâ€™t tell a good story. But 
either of those interpretations are not particularly comforting.â€?It seems that while investors donâ€™t mind Musk making wildly optimistic predictions or 
mocking competitors, theyâ€™re troubled by having their own valid, relevant financial questions derided during a finance-focused call. Now, they are 
not just concerned about Teslaâ€™s financial health. Some, at least, are concerned about the man leading the company they jointly 
own.The timing of this misbehavior is not good: The Model 3 is supposed to be the thing that takes Tesla 
from VC-funded darling to a standalone, profitable automaker. It has struggled to make the transition, burning egregious amounts of money 
and lagging badly on production goals in the nine months since it started building the $35,000 sedan in earnest. Musk 
says he doesnâ€™t want to raise money again in 2018, but Tesla might have to.The Silicon Valley automaker has always 
been a long term bet. Musk never promised profits before the Model 3 entered mass production. But now the car 
is here, the assembly line is in business, Musk promises the numbers with the dollar signs will go from red 
to black by the fall. If they donâ€™tâ€”and history has not been kind to Muskâ€™s self-imposed deadlinesâ€”heâ€™ll need his investorsâ€™ 
goodwill.Muskâ€™s decision to attack, rather than help, his financial questioners hardly spells doom. But it gives the tea leaves a 
good swirlâ€”and the sunny forecast they once promised is looking a bit more like rain.Tesla in TroubleBuying a Model 3?

Data: 
	Transportation is a world full of visionaries: big ideas gone even bigger. It attracts world shakers (and breakers) like 
Grimesâ€™ Boyfriend, Travis Kalanick, and Mark Moore, a 30-year NASA veteran who decamped last year for Uberâ€™s new flying car 
project. There are lots of fanciful renderings and prototypes, lots of pulled-off covers and pointing of spotlights. But thereâ€™s a 
lot of busted dreams too. Plans that run out of money, petering out and puttering toward death. Collectors who come 
calling. Cars that crash and kill.Which is all to say: It was a mixed bag of a week. Senior writer 
Jack Stewart covered the two-day bonanza that was Uberâ€™s second-annual, and completely serious, flying car summit. Editor Alex Davies took 
a close look at startup Drive.aiâ€™s upcoming self-driving shuttle launch in unlikely Frisco, Texas. Fun stuff! But ugly stuff too: 
Teslaâ€™s investor insurrection, thanks (in part) to Grimesâ€™ Boyfriendâ€™s indelicate earnings call comments. A Waymo crash in Arizona that doesnâ€™t 
appear to have anything to do with self-driving tech but had really unfortunate timing anyway. And a jump in pedestrian 
deathsâ€”which weâ€™ll need much more than autonomous vehicles to prevent.Letâ€™s get you caught up.HeadlinesStories you might have missed from WIRED 
this weekUber wants to play middleman in the flying car future, slinging app-ordered rides that take riders smoothly from A 
to B as the fools in ground-bound vehicles sit in traffic below. But that doesnâ€™t mean it wonâ€™t have a 
hand in the flying car design. This week, the ride-hailing giant turned transportation-everything unveiled an all-electric VTOL concept, and reiterated 
its commitment to an ambitious timeline: commercial flights by 2022.Last weekâ€™s Tesla fireworks continue, with an activist investor now pushing 
the electric carmakerâ€™s shareholders to banish three of its nine board members in favor of folks with relevant manufacturing expertise. 
One way Grimesâ€™ Boyfriend could kill the insurrection? By making more cars.In more Tesla news: The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration clarified that the carmaker, and not the federal agency, came up with a much-cited Autopilot safety statistic. Which meant 
it was a good time for me to ask: How much do we know about Autopilot safety record, anyway?Late last 
week, a Waymo minivan being driven by a human got seriously banged up by an out-of-control Honda driver. Police in 
Chandler, Arizona, determined the Waymo vehicle wasnâ€™t at fault, but the scary photos of the banged-up Chrysler Pacifica were spookily 
reminiscent of this springâ€™s fatal Uber crash.Yeehaw! Alex explores Drive.aiâ€™s plans to launch a self-driving shuttle service in the Lone 
Star State, and why geofenced and limited shuttle routes just might be lots of Americansâ€™ first experiences with autonomous vehicles.Heck 
naw! Contributor Nick Stockton tries to get to the bottom of why Nashville, Tennessee, voters soundly rejected an ambitious transit 
revamp meant to improve transportation in the traffic-choked city.The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released a disturbing study on pedestrian 
deaths, finding fatalities jumped by 46 percent between 2009 and 2016. Some say autonomous vehicles will solve all our road 
safety problems, but the tech has a ways to go. I explore another option: getting much smarter about road design.

when Teslaâ€™s CEO showed up to the Met Gala with Canadian musician and artist Grimes. The meme-ers went wild, I 
went wild, and someone created a Chrome browser extension that replaces â€œGrimesâ€™ Boyfriendâ€? with â€œGrimesâ€™ Boyfriendâ€?. OK, maybe Iâ€™ve had 
it turned on all day.Required ReadingNews from elsewhere on the internetThe Information reports Uber has found that its self-driving softwareâ€”not 
its sensorsâ€”are responsible for Marchâ€™s deadly Arizona collision. Two sources say the software identified but â€œfiltered outâ€? the pedestrian as

Data: 
	No, youâ€™re not imagining things. The timelines for autonomous vehicles keep shifting. Electric carmaker Tesla began selling a $3,000 
â€œfull self-drivingâ€? add-on to its Autopilot feature in 2016â€”everything you need to drive without driving!â€”but still hasnâ€™t turned it on. 
In 2012, Googleâ€™s Sergey Brin said â€œordinary peopleâ€? would have access to self-driving cars by 2017; the company is still 
gearing up for a very limited driverless taxi service this year. Volvo quietly delayed a project that was supposed to 
put 100 Swedish families into autonomous vehicles by 2017.No one wants unready tech on public roads, but for anyone who 
has bought into the technologyâ€™s promise to save lives, the delay is a bummer. To put it very lightly. Almost 
40,000 Americans died on the road last year. And a new study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety finds 
ugly driving trends have hit one group particularly hard: pedestrians. Nearly 6,000 pedestrian died in 2016, a 46 percent jump 
over 2009. And if robots wonâ€™t save the bipeds, who will?Your friendly carbon-based neighborhood traffic engineer canâ€”and they donâ€™t even 
need artificial intelligence or $75,000 laser sensors to do it.â€œIf there is too much emphasis on autonomous vehicles solving the 
problem, when widespread deployability is decades in the future and not next year, I think it increases the temptation to 
hope that the technology is going to save us,â€? says Liisa Ecola, a transportation planner and senior policy analyst with 
the Rand Corporation. â€œTraffic safety is a big problem now and to ignore the things we can do, I think, 
is a disservice to the tens of thousands of people who are killed every year in crashes.â€?So forget robots. Engineers 
and the public officials who dole out their paychecks can start redesigning streets to make them safer. They can zoom 
in on their problem areasâ€”is there a section of road where people keep getting hurt?â€”and start fixing roads today.The IIHS 
study points to the walking pain points, the issues to be solved. Between 2009 and 2016, deaths on arterialsâ€”the high-capacity, 
wide, multilane roads that feed into freeways or highwaysâ€”jumped 67 percent. Deaths at sections of roads that werenâ€™t intersections went 
up 50 percent. Deaths in the dark rose by more than half.The good news is that road engineers have access 
to a suite of â€œtraffic-calmingâ€? measures, which would slow down cars on otherwise fast-paced roads and could prevent many crashes. 
In fact, Scandinavian-inspired Vision Zero programs, which seek to totally eliminate road deaths and have been adopted by hundreds of 
places in the US, lay out basic principles for preventing deaths.Letâ€™s take a particular example of a terrible and tragic 
road death. In March, Arizona resident Elaine Herzberg died when she was struck by a self-driving Uber on a wide, 
multilane road in Tempe, Arizona. The crash made clear the fallibility not just of robotsâ€”we dont know why the Uber 
didnâ€™t hit the brakes or swerveâ€”but of humans. The Uber employee sitting behind the wheel, charged with grabbing the wheel 
to prevent crashes, was looking away from the road when the SUV hit Herzberg.A better robot could have saved Herzbergâ€™s 
life, but so might have better road design. Tempe is pretty typical for a middling-density place. Engineers built its arterials 
to transport cars, and quickly. Their long, straight lines are easy for drivers to navigate but induce a slow, lazy 
â€œzoning out,â€? and a level of comfort that makes it easier to glance away from the road.Deaths like Herzebergâ€™s, on 
streets like Tempeâ€™s, might have been prevented with more frequent and shorter crosswalks. Herzberg, wheeling a bicycle weighed down with 
plastic bags, was about 100 yards from the nearest crosswalk when she died. Thatâ€™s not too far, but given how 
many crosswalks on urban arterials are miles away from each other, itâ€™s not hard to comprehend why a walker like 
Herzberg might risk a run across the road.Another option is to put a street on what engineers call a â€œroad 
diet,â€? narrowing or even eliminating lanes of traffic. Reducing the margin of error makes drivers more likely to pay attentionâ€”research 
evaluated by the Federal Highway Administration suggests road diets can cut crashes by more than 30 percent, and pedestrian deaths 
or injuries by more than 20.Safety-minded engineers suggest that even simply adding trees or landscaping to the sides of roads 
adds eye-catching elements that can force drivers to focus. Things like â€œbulb outs,â€? which jut into the street at intersections 
and shorten distances between corners for pedestrians, work too. Any way engineers can get drivers to slow the heck down 
is helpful. The faster a car is moving, the more likely it is to kill someone in a collision. Youâ€™re 
as much as 5.5 times more likely to kill someone hitting them at 40 mph than 30 mph.(Oh, and drive 
smaller cars too. The IIHS study notes a spike in deaths among those hit by the larger trucks and SUVs 
Americans cannot stop buying.)Implementing these fixes should be far easier than teaching a robot to interpret a traffic copâ€™s hand 
signals. Most transportation engineers now joining the workforce should be well-acquainted with these strategies, and ready to emphasize safety over 
speed. And compared to the economic impact of crashesâ€”not to mention the loss of livesâ€”Vision Zeroâ€“type interventions cost pennies.But thatâ€™s 
not always the way it turns out in city hall. Infrastructure funding is scarce. Drivers can get hostile when you 
suggest slowing their commutes for the sake of, well, anything. And scientists are still struggling to pin rising pedestrian deaths 
on any one factor. â€œTraffic safety is really a very multidisciplinary problem,â€? says Ecola. â€œItâ€™s not something we can fix 
just with engineering solutions or just with campaigns to get people to wear their seatbelts more often. Itâ€™s all of 
those things.â€?Still, if tragic crashes donâ€™t get politiciansâ€™ attention, what will? Hopefully not just the robo-cars that always seem a 
horizon away.On the Road AgainUber makes peace with cities by spilling its secretsWhy traffic-choked Nashville said nope to public transitA

Data: 
	How much do workers at tech firms make?The answer varies a lot, depending on the employer. The median employee 
at Amazon made $28,446 last year, according to new disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. At Facebook, the 
median employee made $240,430, more than eight times as much.There are reasons for the big disparity, of course: Facebookâ€™s 25,000 
employees include many software engineers, which it must recruit in the expensive and competitive San Francisco Bay Area. Most of 
Amazonâ€™s 566,000 employees work in its distribution centers, including many overseas; in the US, Amazon says the average hourly wage 
in its distribution centers is more than $15 an hour, which translates to slightly more than $30,000 a year, before 
overtime.Other disparities reflect differences in companiesâ€™ businesses, and business models. As a car maker, Tesla says 26 percent of its 
employees are production workers and 18 percent are outside the US. The company reported median employee pay of $54,816. Tesla 
says its employees also have benefited from increases in the companyâ€™s share price. IBM, which has aggressively moved jobs overseas 
in recent years, reported median pay of $54,491. The New York Times reported in September that IBM now has more 
employees in India than in the US. An IBM spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Even within the same 
tech sector, median pay can vary significantly based on a companyâ€™s business model. Intel, the largest US maker of semiconductors 
by revenue, makes its own chips. Three of its six manufacturing sites are in the US, as are half of 
its 102,000 employees. The company reported median pay of $102,100. Nvidia, whose graphics chips are used widely for machine learning 
and artificial intelligence, reported median pay of $147,640. The company contracts out the manufacturing of its chips and has only 
about 8,200 employees. A spokesperson says half of Nvidiaâ€™s employees are in the â€œhighly competitiveâ€? Silicon Valley market and that 
its employees are â€œhighly skilled, college educated, and have deep expertiseâ€“all of which command a premium in the market.â€?The median 
pay figures underscore that intense competition for tech talent in the Bay Area. Nationally, the average pay for software developers 
and programmers is $102,470, according to the US Labor Department. Bay Area tech firms are paying considerably more: The median 
pay at Workday, which makes software that helps businesses manage finances and people, is $178,903, according to its proxy statement. 
At Salesforce, another business-software maker, itâ€™s $155,284; and at payments processor Square, itâ€™s $152,265.Companies are disclosing the median pay of 
employees for the first time this year under a new SEC rule intended to shine a light on the high 
pay of CEOs. The rule took effect for fiscal years ending December 31, 2017, or later, so companies on different 
fiscal calendars, including Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, wonâ€™t report their median-pay figures until later this year.Companies have to report the 
ratio of the pay of their CEOs to the median pay of their employees. The Wall Street Journal reported that 
Marathon Petroleum CEO Gary Heminger was paid $19.7 million last year, or 935 times the $21,034 salary of the companyâ€™s 
median worker.The ratios are less meaningful for big tech companies because many of their CEOs are founders who own large 
chunks of the company and receive only nominal compensation. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey received no compensation, according to the companyâ€™s 
proxy statement. Facebookâ€™s Mark Zuckerberg and Google parent Alphabetâ€™s Larry Page each were paid $1. Zuckerbergâ€™s reported compensation also included 
$8.8 million for company-provided security services and travel on company planes. Amazonâ€™s Jeff Bezos was paid a salary of $81,840, 
as he has been annually since 1998; his compensation included $1.6 million for security services paid by the company.Money, Money,

Data: 
	Update: SpaceX scrubbed Thursday launch after an abort during the countdown sequence. The next window opened Friday at 4:14pm 
Eastern. The Falcon 9 successfully launched and its first stage landed on the drone ship off the coast of Florida, 
which marks the company 25th landing.SpaceX is set to launch the Block 5 version of its flagship rocket, the Falcon 
9, at 4:12 pm Eastern on Thursday, an event that signals that reusable rockets are here to stayâ€”or, rather, to 
boldly go. This upgraded version of the Falcon is expected to launch, land, and re-launch multiple times with little down 
time in between flights.Today mission marks the first time SpaceX has returned to Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center following 
the epic maiden flight of its massive rocket, the Falcon Heavy. That highly anticipated launch captivated crowds across the world 
on February 6, as it ascended through the atmosphere, carrying Elon Muskâ€™s cherry red Tesla roadster (and a dummy driver, 
Starman) into space.LoadingView on InstagramNow, SpaceX will make its long-awaited transition to the Block 5â€”which may not look incredibly different 
than previous versions, but packs a much bigger punch: 1.8 million pounds of thrust, which amounts to a 7 percent 
increase in power. The rocket will lift off sometime during a planned two-hour and 25-minute window and ferry the Bangabandhu-1 
satellite to space. Then the first stage booster will return to Earth, where itâ€™ll try to stick a landing on 
the company drone ship, Of Course I Still Love You, waiting in the Atlantic Ocean.(The nearly 8,000-pound Bangabandhu-1 satellite will 
bring commercial communications capabilities to a rural region of Asia for up to 15 years after being placed into orbit. 
Itâ€™s the first satellite for Bangladesh, making it the 58th country to operate its own satellite in geostationary orbit.)Amy ThompsonSpaceXâ€™s 
philosophy has always been that a fully (and rapidly) reusable rocket is the key to dramatically reducing the cost of 
spaceflight. Currently, a Falcon 9 rocket costs around $62 million, and while SpaceX is currently successfully reusing first-stage boostersâ€”the most 
expensive portion of the rocketâ€”Elon Musk would like to get to the point where much more is reused, essentially ensuring 
that fuel becomes the only major expense. To that end, SpaceX is also attempting to recover and reuse the payload 
fairingsâ€”the protective nose cone that shields the rocketâ€™s cargo as it travels through the atmosphereâ€”with the help of a new 
West Coast based recovery vehicle dubbed Mr. Steven.The vessel, outfitted with a claw-like catcherâ€™s mitt was first employed earlier this 
year during a mission to launch the Paz satellite. The fairing is an expensive piece of hardware, which historically has 
been discarded, costs about 10 percent of the overall price tag of the Falcon 9, so being able to recover 
and reuse it would be a win for SpaceX. Currently, after separation from the rocketâ€™s upper stage, the two halves 
of the fairing navigate back to Earth before a parachute deploys and they land in the ocean.So far Mr. Steven 
has been unsuccessful in its attempts to snag the fairings, but SpaceX gathers data from each attempt, and will ideally 
make a successful catch in the near future.The previous version of the Falcon 9, dubbed the full thrust variant, was 
only capable of flying two or three times at most. If SpaceX is to meet its ultimate goal of flying 
daily, a rocket that can only fly twice is not practical. Hereâ€™s where the Block 5 is crucial.The Block 5, 
a culmination of more than 10 years of development, marks the final design iteration for the Falcon 9 and will 
be the version the company relies on as its workhorse for the foreseeable future. It designed to re-fly as soon 
as 48 hours after landingâ€”a dramatic reduction in the downtime SpaceX rockets currently require.The Block 5 accomplishes this thanks to 
a set of upgrades including improved engines, a more durable interstage, titanium grid fins, and an improved thermal protection system, 
which hold up better to the stresses of launch. And gone are the days of the all-white Falconâ€”the spiffy new 
interstage, along with a set of new, retractable landing legs are painted black. According to SpaceX, the Block 5 is 
capable of flying 10 times or more, needing only light refurbishments, and up to 100 times before the booster is 
retired.SpaceX plans to use the Block 5 to launch astronauts to the space station as early as 2019. In order 
to achieve that goal, it has to fly the Block 5 at least seven times without making any alterations to 
the design, and there are around 20 launches left on the schedule this year. This is shaping up to be

Data: 
	For a company working its way into an industry that specializes in annihilating newcomers, Tesla has proven remarkably persistent. 
It has dodged bankruptcy, built an enormous fan base, and rolled out a series of terrific automobiles that made electric 
cars cool. But the secret to the companyâ€™s endurance is that someone up there likes itâ€”up there being top floor 
corner offices occupied by the investors who have kept Tesla running through 15 profitless years.Now that Tesla is facing a 
series of crisesâ€”a variety of lawsuits, interrogations over the safety of its Autopilot feature, and, most of all, lagging Model 
3 productionâ€”some of those up on high are revealing themselves as Old Testamentâ€“style gods: displeased with what they see happening 
on the ground, and ready to smite.This morning, an activist investor published a letter calling for Tesla shareholders to kick 
three of its nine board members off the board and replace them with people with more relevant experience who will 
be less likely to defer to defiant demigod CEO Elon Musk.The problem is the reality is starting to stack up, 
and thatâ€™s a reality of accidents the cars have had, quality issues, and massive misses on Model 3 production numbers,â€? 
writes that investor, Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW investment group. â€œYou add all that up and thereâ€™s a 
real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.Now that Tesla is mass producing cars, running an energy 
business, and has some 40,000 employees, Waizenegger says it needs board members with experience in manufacturing, utilities, and management, and 
whoâ€™ll be willing to help Musk through various hiccups. â€œThey need to change the composition of the board to reflect 
the evolving business strategy,â€? he says. Tesla expanded its board last year, adding 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch and 
Johnson Publishing Company CEO Linda Johnson Riceâ€”hardly the expertise Waizenegger hoped for, he says. â€œWe needed to do something more 
dramatic.â€?Muskâ€™s refusal to answer analyst queries about Model 3 orders and capital requirements during an investor call last month (he 
dismissed them as â€œboring, bonehead questionsâ€?) didnâ€™t assuage any concerns. â€œWe want the company to survive,â€? Waizenegger says. â€œIt is 
therefore concerning if youâ€™re not able to have a serious conversation with analysts.â€?So, at Teslaâ€™s annual meeting on June 5, 
CtW wants its fellow shareholders to vote against the reelection to the board of venture capitalist Antonio Gracias, Elonâ€™s brother 
Kimbal Musk, and Murdoch. (Like in the Senate, only third of Tesla board members come up for reelection at a 
time.) Itâ€™s another way of saying: Musk should keep the top spot, but he needs more oversight. Tesla declined to 
comment.Waizenegger has long voiced his concerns about Teslaâ€™s board, which has hardly changed since the company went public in 2010, 
and most of whose members have close personal ties to Musk.CtW may be right, but that doesnâ€™t make it mighty. 
And volubility does not mean anybody will join the cause. The firm, which runs pension funds sponsored by Change to 
Win, a federation of unions, holds about 260,000 Tesla shares. By comparison, the automakerâ€™s largest shareholder, Fidelity, holds more than 
16 million. And despite Muskâ€™s concerning performance on that investor call, Tesla seems to be headed in the right direction, 
saying it should hit its target of building 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week in the next few months, and 
reach profitability soon after. Just the sort of thing that should soothe anxious investors.â€œIâ€™m betting almost all of these problems 
would be fine if Model 3 production went to 5,000 plus, starting relatively soon,â€? says Karl Brauer, an auto industry 
analyst with Kelley Blue Book. â€œYou can point to plenty of automakers that have had plenty of controversial issues crop 
up. But if theyâ€™re overall profitable, people rightly assume theyâ€™ll get through it.â€?Waizenegger maintains that experienced board members willing to 
help Musk manage the company are crucial to Teslaâ€™s future. The automaker is in a particularly tough spot right now, 
fighting a series of crises as it tries to roll out the Model 3, the car thatâ€™s supposed to bring 
electric driving to the masses and profits to investors. So the doubters may be more numerous and audible than usual. 
But if Musk has proven anything, itâ€™s that he can sell people on a vision and deliverâ€”even if it takes 
a Hail Mary.All About ElonTesla favorite Autopilot safety stat just doesnt stand upMusk ire reveals a Wall Street-Silicon Valley divideTesla

	In the evolving geographic distribution of self-driving cars, the go-to getaway is Arizona, where good weather and minimal government 
interference make testing two-ton robots something like fun in the sun. But as with all such places, the more crowded 
it gets, the less people want to go there any more. Maybe thatâ€™s why Mountain Viewâ€“based startup Drive.ai isnâ€™t taking 
its robo-cars to the land of the Grand Canyon, but to the wilds of the Lone Star State.Starting in July, 
the company will run a fleet of driverless vehicles around Frisco, Texas, a city of 164,000 people on the northern 
edge of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area. Announced today, the six-month pilotâ€”which will keep human safety operators behind the wheel, 
ready to grab control if the car gets confused or misbehavesâ€”marks Drive.aiâ€™s first large-scale effort to put people in its 
cars, and the first such deployment in Texas. Waymo has done some testing in Austin, but this service will provide 
regular rides to the public.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Self-Driving CarsThe Drive.ai setup will look like more like an airport 
shuttle than a taxi service. The companyâ€™s easily recognizable orange and blue Nissan NV200 vans will run only in a 
tightly geofenced area, along fixed routes.Drive.ai hasnâ€™t divulged much in the way of details, but says one such route will 
serve employees at an office park in the southern bit of the city, taking them between buildings and to a 
nearby stadium and apartment complex, at no charge. It will use fixed pickup and drop-off locations, so the cars donâ€™t 
have to worry about finding a safe space to pull over.â€œBy choosing geofenced regions and working with partners, we can 
take advantage of self-driving carsâ€™ strengths while diminishing their weaknesses,â€? says Andrew Ng, a member of Drive.aiâ€™s board, and a 
leading artificial intelligence expert.For the foreseeable future, this is how everyone will manage their fleets. Making a car that can 
handle any conceivable situation is just too hard; the world is too complex. By limiting a vehicle to fixed routes, 
or at least a limited area, you can be sure youâ€™ve got fully updated maps, you can keep track of 
conditions like construction that might make things tricky, and you can stick to the simplest situations. As your technology proves 
itself and everyone starts to feel more confident, you can expand.Drive.ais vans will use exterior screens to communicate with people 
on the street.Drive.aiIndeed, in later stages of this project, Drive.ai hopes to dump the human backup driver and fill the 
passenger seat with a human â€œchaperone,â€? to help guide passengers through the service. And, like just about every company working 
on autonomous operations, it will have ready-to-help humans sitting in a remote location, monitoring the vehicles and issuing instructions as 
needed.Drive.ai stands out among the host of companies in this space for its consideration of how its vehicles talk to 
the world around them. Because, when you put a computer in charge, you lose the human ability to wave a 
pedestrian ahead, or make the eye contact that lets that cyclist know you see her.â€œWe need to be able to 
communicate in all directions, and we need to be able to show intention and have a conversation with the other 
players on the road,â€? Drive.ai co-founder and president Carol Reiley told WIRED back in 2016, when the company was starting 
to test with roof-mounted â€œbillboardsâ€? that could display messages. For the Frisco pilot, the Nissan vans will have panels mounted 
on all sides to say things like â€œWaiting for you to cross,â€? â€œpulling over,â€? and â€œpassengers entering.â€?And now, maybe, â€œWelcome 
to Texas, home of the robo-revolution.â€?Robo-RevolutionSelf-driving cars have a secret weapon: humans in call centersTesla favorite Autopilot safety stat just

Data: 
	Wall Street and Silicon Valley have never been happy bedfellows, and that was on full display this week during 
Teslaâ€™s quarterly earnings call. These calls are usually dull affairs, with CEOs or CFOs reading a prepared script summarizing the 
already-released financial results and articulating the main goals of the company that have, presumably, been stated before. Then Wall Street 
analysts ask a series of questions about the results, tactics, and strategy that executives artfully dodge or dutifully answer. Much 
like press conferences, the format does not lend itself to spontaneity.WIRED OpinionAboutZachary Karabell is a WIRED Contributor. Karabell is the 
head of Global Strategies Envestnet and the president of River Twice Research.Except when the company is Tesla and the CEO 
is Elon Musk. The press after this weekâ€™s call was intensely critical of Musk for dismissing questions, refusing to delve 
into financial details, and musing about robo-Ubers and autonomous electric trucks cutting into rail transport. More than most, the call 
exposed the starkly different perspectives of Wall Street and the valley. Musk clearly is avoiding some hard questions about Teslaâ€™s 
financial viability. But itâ€™s equally true that the call exposed how limited Wall Street can be about visions for the 
future and what it takes to create new templates for doing old things.Musk is not your normal CEO, of course, 
with his multiple interlocking companies and his abilityâ€”so farâ€”to convince investors to go along for a ride that promises the 
moon (or Mars in the case of his SpaceX) and delivers no earnings while taking on huge amounts of debt. 
But even by those standards, his refusal to answer basic questions about, say, how much cash Tesla is burning through 
and whether the company has a plan to continue subsidizing and capitalizing its expenses struck Wall Street as odd and 
a sign of deep problems.What made this call peculiar was the way Musk dismissed sober questions by respected Wall Street 
analysts such as Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein, who pressed Musk about costs and cash. Musk brushed him off, sniping that 
â€œbonehead, boring questions are not cool.â€? To add insult to that injury, Musk then fielded questions from a YouTube user, 
who proceeded to dominate a call normally open only to significant Wall Street analysts. That did not sit well with 
the Street, and Sacconaghi lambasted Musk the next day on CNBC with the rather clever jab, â€œThis is a financial 
analyst call, this is not a TED talk.â€? Friday, Musk returned fire, with tweets asserting that the question was boneheaded 
because the analyst already knew the answer and was asking purely to advocate a negative thesis about the company.Muskâ€™s sparring 
with analysts recalls similar tensions between Wall Street analysts and Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Reed Hastings of Netflix, Mark Zuckerberg 
of Facebook and other arrogant, aggressive, and visionary technology CEOs. The analysts consistently press for metrics including revenue, margins, cash 
burn, and earnings projections. The CEOs routinely try to emphasize growth, users, experience, and long-term vision. The analysts press on 
expenses, competitors, cost of capital; the CEOs dodge and weave and point to strategy, new models, breaking old molds, and 
creating new marketplaces. And so the dance goes.The power has shifted back and forth since the real explosion of tech 
companies on Wall Street during the 1990s. During the dot-com euphoria of the late 1990s, the concerns of traditional Wall 
Street analysts were seen as quaint, stodgy, and hopelessly backward. Who cares about traditionally viable business models, the techies essentially 
said; we are creating entirely new channels. After the Nasdaq bubble burst in 2000, the momentum shifted to Wall Street; 
actually, cash matters, and having a real business with real revenue has to be part of the equation sooner rather 
than later. In recent years, there has been more convergence, with a handful of tech companies growing into potent businesses 
respected by Wall Street and attracting massive investor interest.The Tesla conundrum again crystallizes this conflict. Analysts demand a sense of 
when, and how, the company will generate cash and stop accumulating debt; Musk finds such concerns secondary to building out 
an ecosystem of battery production, propulsion and motor systems, renewable-powered robotic factories, and new modes of production meant to revolutionize 
how heavy stuff is made as surely as Henry Ford and Frederick Winslow Taylor did in the early 20th century.Ideally, 
one wouldnâ€™t pick sides. After all, even Musk knows that at some point, his businesses will have to generate earnings 
and cash. Debt, however raised, isnâ€™t endlessâ€”unless you are a sovereign government. But he also believes that unless the entire 
ecosystem is built out, it will fail. Hence the focus on massive capital spending and plowing into new business lines. 
Bezos had a similar ethos with Amazon, and essentially told Wall Street that he was going to follow his own 
vision and that investors were welcome to come along for the ride but not to drive. Those investors have been 
rewarded and then some. Of course, investors in Jawbone and Webvan were also promised transformation and ended up with nothing.Musk 
is telling investors that they can choose whether to buy in to his vision, but that they canâ€™t challenge it. 
Given that almost no one in the analyst and investor community has ever built or run a mold-breaking business, telling 
them that they can accept or reject the vision isnâ€™t unreasonable.Wall Street is often extremely good at what it does. 
Bankers and analysts understand how to price debt and equities while assessing the potential of loss, which they do diligently 
and conservatively (except when they fail spectacularly). But Wall Street is not, for the most part, the playground of those 
who define the future. That requires tolerating extreme risk and conceiving how things could be done differently. Most visionaries will 
be utterly wrong about their vision, because they are early, or overreach, or miscalculate. Buying Tesla stock is immensely risky, 
perhaps even ill-advised. That does not mean Musk should alter what he does or how he does it. In fact, 
managing his enterprises to please Wall Street is an almost certain path to failure; the numbers donâ€™t add upâ€”and wonâ€™tâ€”unless 
everything works almost perfectly. Whether you go along for the investing ride is up to you, but Teslaâ€™s fate should 
not be up to Wall Street analysts.Baby You Can Drive My CarWith his recent outburst, has Elon Musk gone from

Data: 
	What do you think about Elon Musk? Tell me and Iâ€™ll know a lot about your attitudes toward, well, 
most things. Take this weekâ€™s first quarter earnings call. Executives at your average carmakerâ€”your average public company, evenâ€”would bore to 
numbness all but the most invested investors. But Elon has no time for â€œboring, boneheadâ€? calls. So he got rather 
saucy on his, cutting off those tedious penny pinchers. Either you see him as a maverickâ€”a boy gone delightfully big 
money, saving the world as he swingsâ€”or as an irresponsible leader who sent his companyâ€™s stock (which, reminder, many of 
his employees own) shuddering down the y-axis.No matter what you think of Musk, it was his week. Transportation editor Alex 
Davies tackled what Teslaâ€™s first quarter numbers and that exceedingly interesting earnings call means for the electric carmaker. Meanwhile, senior 
writer Jack Stewart reminded savvy buyers Tesla will soon run out of the governmentâ€™s generous EV tax credits. Plus: bike-share, 
e-scooters, and an Autopilot statistic gone awry.It was a (Tesla) week. Letâ€™s get you caught up.HeadlinesStories you might have missed 
from WIRED this weekTesla will make its 200,000th electric car sometime this year, and General Motors may not be far 
behind. Thatâ€™s an impressive milestone with an unfortunate side effect: The carmakers will lose access to the federal governmentâ€™s $7,500 
purchase credit. Jack explores the strategy around selling EVs in a slightly more expensive world.The doom and gloom crowd had 
predicted dismal first quarter numbers from Tesla. But when the electric carmaker released its figures on Wednesday, they contained a 
bit of a surprise: production is up, and profitability might be in sight. The company just has to stick to 
the scheduleâ€”and defy history doing it.Then Elon got on the phone and mucked it up a bit, cutting off â€œdryâ€? 
analyst questions in favor of expansive, future-looking queries. You know, the fun stuff. The stock market was displeased, and Alex 
wondered whether the 46-year-old boy wonder is becoming more liability than asset.Musk isnâ€™t the only auto head prepping for the 
future. Contributor Nicholas Stecher spoke to Wilko Stark, the guy in charge of Daimlerâ€™s connected, autonomous, shared, and electric strategies. 
One big takeaway: the company that owns Mercedes-Benz ainâ€™t scared of Waymo, Apple, or Uber.Business reporter Klint Finley takes a 
close look at what could be a game-changing ruling by the California Supreme Court, which found one companyâ€™s drivers are 
in fact employees. Thatâ€™s a bad precedent for Uber, Lyft, and the rest of the gig economy.If your vision of 
the future of cars doesnâ€™t involve cars at all, some excellent newsâ€”people are definitely still working on ways to get 
you around the city. I explore the Los Angeles Metroâ€™s pathbreaking approach to collaborate with the private sector (there might 
be gondolas involved?), the spectacular growth of electric scooter-share market, and why Americans are going ga-ga for bike-share.The Enduring Mystery 
of the WeekIf you happen to know how or why an empty Honda Civic ended up hanging from a utility 
pole beneath a Toronto bridge, please send me a note.https://twitter.com/madmal99/status/991696988327493632Required ReadingNews from elsewhere on the internetBloomberg breaks down Teslaâ€™s financials 
and kills the GIF game.A Michigan grand jury indicated ex-Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn and five other former company execs on 
felony charges related to the automakerâ€™s plot to game US emissions standards with its diesel cars.A CNN investigations uncovers 103 
accusations of sexual assault or abuse against Uber drivers. A senator is now getting involved with the push to allow 
victims to take their cases against Uber out of forced arbitration and into open court.In the midst of a spate 
of taxi driver suicides, New York mayor Bill de Blasio signals he might be ready to revisit the idea of 
capping the number of ride-hail vehicles in the city.The Information uncovers how Lyftâ€™s missteps doomed its ambitions to catch up 
to Uber. Highlights include: How Lyft mucked up the rollout of Lyft Line, why the guy now running e-scooter-share company 
Bird left the company, and what dog hung out in Travis Kalanickâ€™s house as the ride-hail companies discussed a merger.Forget 
Waymo. The Pentagon might beat everyone to autonomous vehicles.Volkswagen and ride-hailing giant Didi are hooking up in China.A coalition of

James Bond or Indiana Jones. In 2010, WIREDâ€™s Josh Davis chronicled how Elon Musk led the automaker through its early 
days, then its darkest days, and made it the car company of the future. Related VideoCultureThese Star Wars Fans Are

Data: 
	For more than a year, Tesla has defended its semiautonomous Autopilot as a vital, life-saving feature. CEO Elon Musk 
has lambasted journalists who write about crashes involving the system. â€œIt really incredibly irresponsible of any journalists with integrity to 
write an article that would lead people to believe that autonomy is less safe,â€? he said during a tumultuous earnings 
call this week. â€œBecause people might actually turn it off, and then die.â€?This wasnâ€™t the first time Musk has made 
this argument about Autopilot, which keeps the car in its lane and a safe distance from other vehicles but requires 
constant human oversight, and has been involved in two fatal crashes in the US. â€œWriting an article thatâ€™s negative, youâ€™re 
effectively dissuading people from using autonomous vehicles, youâ€™re killing people,â€? he said on an October 2016 conference call.Wednesdayâ€™s haranguing, however, 
came a few hours after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) indicated that Tesla has been misconstruing the key 
statistic it uses to defend its technology. Over the past year and a half, Tesla spokespeople have repeatedly said that 
the agency has found Autopilot to reduce crash rates by 40 percent. They repeated it most recently after the death 
of a Northern California man whose Model X crashed into a highway safety barrier while in Autopilot mode in March.Now 
NHTSA says thatâ€™s not exactly rightâ€”and thereâ€™s no clear evidence for how safe the pseudo-self-driving feature actually is.LEARN MOREThe WIRED 
Guide to Self-Driving CarsThe remarkable stat comes from a January 2017 report that summarized NHTSAâ€™s investigation into the death of 
Joshua Brown, whose Model S crashed into a truck turning across its path while in Autopilot mode. According to its 
data, model year 2014 through 2016 Teslas saw 1.3 airbag deployments per million miles, before Tesla made Autopilot available via 
an over-the-air software update. Afterward, the rate was 0.8 per million miles. â€œThe data show that the Tesla vehicles crash 
rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation,â€? the investigators concluded.Just a few problems. First, as reported by Reuters 
and confirmed to WIRED, NHTSA has reiterated that its data came from Tesla, and has not been verified by an 
independent party (as it noted in a footnote in the report). Second, it says its investigators did not consider whether 
the driver was using Autopilot at the time of each crash. (Reminder: Drivers are only supposed to use Autopilot in 
very specific contexts.) And third, airbag deployments are an inexact proxy for crashes. Especially considering that in the death that 
triggered the investigation, the airbags did not deploy.Tesla declined to comment on NHTSAâ€™s clarification.The statistic has been the subject of 
controversy for some time. The research firm Quality Control Systems Corp. has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against 
NHTSA for the underlying data in that 2017 report, which it hopes to use to determine whether the 40 percent 
figure is valid. NHTSA has thus far denied its FOIA requests, saying it agreed to Teslaâ€™s requests to keep the 
data confidential, and that its release could threaten the carmakersâ€™ competitiveness.Teslaâ€™s oft-touted figure is flawed for another reason, experts say: 
With this data set, you canâ€™t separate the role of Autopilot from that of automatic emergency braking, which Tesla began 
releasing just a few months before Autopilot. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, vehicles that can detect imminent 
collisions and hit the brakes on their own suffer half as many rear-end crashes as those that canâ€™t. (More than 
99 percent of cars Tesla produced in 2017 came equipped with the feature standard, a higher proportion than any other 
carmaker.)Which is all to say, determining whether a new feature like Autopilot is safe, especially if you donâ€™t have access 
to lots of replicable, third-party data, is super, super hard. Teslaâ€™s beloved 40 percent figure comes with so many caveats, 
itâ€™s unreliable.Big Deal DataThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has tried to come at the question another way, by looking 
at the frequency of insurance claims. When it tried to separate Model S sedan incidents after Autopilot was released, it 
observed no changes in the frequency of property damage and bodily injury liability claims. That indicates that Autopilot drivers arenâ€™t 
more or less less likely to damage their cars or get hurt than others. But it did find a 13 
percent reduction in collision claim frequency, indicating sedans with Autopilot enabled got into fewer crashes that resulted in collision claims 
to insurers.Oh, but it gets more complicated. IIHS couldnâ€™t tell which crashes actually involved the use Autopilot, and not just 
sedans equipped with Autopilot. And itâ€™s way too early for definitive answers. â€œSince other safety technologies are layered below Autopilot, 
it is difficult to tease out results for Autopilot alone at this time,â€? says Russ Rader, an IIHS spokesperson. â€œData 
on insurance claims for the Model S are still thin.â€?Over at MIT, researchers frustrated with the dearth of good info 
on Autopilot and other semiautonomous car features have launched their own lines of inquiry. Human guinea pigs are now driving 
sensor- and camera-laden Teslas, Volvos, and Range Rovers around the Boston area. The researchers will use the data they generate 
to understand how safely humans operate those vehicles.The upshot is that Autopilot might, in fact, be saving a ton of 
lives. Or maybe not. We just donâ€™t know. And Tesla hasnâ€™t been transparent with its own numbers. â€œYou would need 
a rigorous statistical analysis with clear data indicating what vehicle has it and what vehicle doesnâ€™t and whether itâ€™s enabled 
or whether it isnâ€™t,â€? says David Friedman, a former NHTSA official who now directs car policy at Consumers Union. Tesla 
said this week that it would begin publishing quarterly Autopilot safety statistics, but did not indicate whether its data would 
be verified by a third party.NHTSA, too, could be doing a better at holding innovative but opaque carmakers like Tesla 
accountable for proving the safety of their new tech. â€œTo me, they should be more transparent by asking Tesla for 
disengagements of the system: How often the systems disengaged, how often the humans need to take over,â€? Friedman says. Californiaâ€™s 
Department of Motor Vehicles requires companies testing autonomous vehicles in the state to provide annual data on disengagements, to help 
officials understand the limitations of the tech and its progress.Tesla is not alone among carmakers in trying to shield sensitive 
info from the public. But today, humans are deeply bewildered about the semiautonomous features that have already made their way 
into everyday driversâ€™ garages. Even Transportation Secretary Elaine Chaoâ€”you know, the public official charged with overseeing regulation on these thingsâ€”is 
confused by the terminology. If thereâ€™s a time to get honest about your numbers, this could be it. You might 
save some lives. Youâ€™d definitely save a few headaches.Tesla TurmoilElon Musk attack on investors could make him a liabilityBuying a

Data: 
	The numbers, arranged on the paper like tea leaves in the fortune-tellerâ€™s cup, heralded a sunny future. Production rates 
up. Market share impressive. Profitability in sight. Tesla had work left to do, but it was moving in the right 
direction, and fast enough to assuage investors wondering when the young automaker would reel in its spending and find its 
way into the black.Then Elon Musk took charge of his own fate. In a public earnings call with investors and 
financial analysts Wednesday afternoon, the CEO attacked two analysts for asking what he called â€œboneheadâ€? and â€œdryâ€? questions, and refused 
to offer answers. By the morning, Teslaâ€™s stock had dropped nearly 10 percent.And so the question becomes unavoidable. Has Musk, 
with his inimitable Ã©lon, gone from asset to liability?Itâ€™s a remarkable turn for a man who stands out, even in 
this age of Silicon Valley leader worship, for his inextricable association with his company. He has never been a conventional 
CEO, and thatâ€™s been more feature than bug over the past decade. He tweets about building cyborg dragons, jokes about 
bankruptcy and mixing Ambien with red wine, and appears on talk shows and Page 6. He has launched Big Fucking 
Rockets, promised traffic-obliterating mazes of tunnels, and conjured a hyperloop industry from nothing. He made electric cars really, really cool. 
After his legions of fans bought 50,000 Boring Company hats for $20 a piece, Musk moved on to $500 flamethrowers. 
He sold 20,000 in under a week.No wonder: Musk is the entrepreneur who ignores conventional wisdom, who silences haters and 
doubters with acceleration records and cars rocketing around the solar system. He attacks the media and fights federal investigators. Itâ€™s 
all part of a hugely popular personal brand that canâ€™t be separated from Teslaâ€™s knack for surviving in an industry 
that kills just about all newcomers. Even when it delivers cars years behind schedule, when executives flee and scandals stack 
up, Muskâ€™s fans remain zealous, and his investors indulgent. Indeed, in March, a large majority of Tesla shareholders approved a 
compensation package that could make Musk $55 billion if he delivers on extraordinary goals, and that effectively locks him in 
the job for the next decade. (Musk discussed the idea of leaving Tesla in 2013, but now says heâ€™s there 
for the long haul.)The read-through is that potentially the CEO doesnâ€™t care or isnâ€™t focused about those financial metrics or 
ultimately the numbers donâ€™t tell a good story.Now, though, Musk has mocked some of the people who are most vital 
to Teslaâ€™s survivalâ€”the investors who have pushed it to valuation that surpasses Fordâ€™sâ€”and paid a price. Wednesdayâ€™s call went south 
when analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein asked about Teslaâ€™s ability to reach a gross margin target of 25 
percent on the Model 3, then about its projected capital requirements. â€œExcuse me,â€? Musk interrupted. â€œNext. Boring bonehead questions are 
not cool. Next?â€?Then came Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets, who asked how many Model 3 reservation holders are actually 
buying the car. â€œSorry. These questions are so dry. Theyre killing me,â€? Musk saidâ€”after 10 seconds of silence. As Musk 
turned to take a long series of questions from a YouTube financial blogger (some of them pointed), the stock started 
dropping in after hours trading, ending up down close to 10 percent.Teslaâ€™s stock has always been volatile, subject to vertigo-inducing 
spikes and dives. On that serrated line, this drop doesnâ€™t stand out for its size. What sets it apart is 
the trigger. Teslaâ€™s quarterly numbers were quite solid. Perhaps truthful, detailed answers to Sacconaghi and Spakâ€™s questions would have been 
unpleasant. But where the conventional CEO might dance around bad news, or hide it in a wooly nest of jargon 
and non-answers, Musk attacked. And he made himself look bad.â€œInvestor feedback to the call was shock that a CEO would 
be dismissive and the general sentiment was that the defensiveness spoke volumes,â€? Spak wrote in a note summarizing the call 
and financial results.â€œThere is incremental concern when, on an analyst financial quarterly call, the CEO doesnâ€™t appear to want to 
talk about important financial metrics,â€? Sacconaghi, the other spurned analyst, said on Bloomberg Television. â€œThe read-through is that potentially the 
CEO doesnâ€™t care or isnâ€™t focused about those financial metrics or ultimately the numbers donâ€™t tell a good story. But 
either of those interpretations are not particularly comforting.â€?It seems that while investors donâ€™t mind Musk making wildly optimistic predictions or 
mocking competitors, theyâ€™re troubled by having their own valid, relevant financial questions derided during a finance-focused call. Now, they are 
not just concerned about Teslaâ€™s financial health. Some, at least, are concerned about the man leading the company they jointly 
own.The timing of this misbehavior is not good: The Model 3 is supposed to be the thing that takes Tesla 
from VC-funded darling to a standalone, profitable automaker. It has struggled to make the transition, burning egregious amounts of money 
and lagging badly on production goals in the nine months since it started building the $35,000 sedan in earnest. Musk 
says he doesnâ€™t want to raise money again in 2018, but Tesla might have to.The Silicon Valley automaker has always 
been a long term bet. Musk never promised profits before the Model 3 entered mass production. But now the car 
is here, the assembly line is in business, Musk promises the numbers with the dollar signs will go from red 
to black by the fall. If they donâ€™tâ€”and history has not been kind to Muskâ€™s self-imposed deadlinesâ€”heâ€™ll need his investorsâ€™ 
goodwill.Muskâ€™s decision to attack, rather than help, his financial questioners hardly spells doom. But it gives the tea leaves a 
good swirlâ€”and the sunny forecast they once promised is looking a bit more like rain.Tesla in TroubleBuying a Model 3?
