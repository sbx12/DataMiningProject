	Whatâ€™s the shiniest, most exciting new technology for transportation? Well, there are plenty of candidates! Weâ€™ve got the self-Â­driving 
car and drones big enough to carry people. Elon Musk is getting ready to bore hyperloop tunnels. When it comes 
to moving humans around, the future looks to be merging with sci-fi.But from where I stand, the most exciting form 
of transportation technology is more than 100 years oldâ€”and itâ€™s probably sitting in your garage. Itâ€™s the bicycle. The future 
of transportation has two thin wheels and handlebars.Modern tech has transformed the humble two-Â­wheeler, making the bike-share model possible: You 
check out a bike from a docking station, use it for an hour or so, then return to any other 
docking station. The concept was tried back in the â€™60s but failed miserably because no one could track where the 
bikes went.Today, thatâ€™s been solved with smartphone-ized tech: GPS, Bluetooth, RFID, and mobile-payment systems. And bike sharing has unlocked a 
ton of American interest in navigating cities on a bike: Usage has grown from 320,000 rides in 2010 to 28 
million in 2016. In China, where gridlock in cities like Beijing is infamous, the trend has grown even faster.But cooler 
tricks are possible. Weâ€™re now seeing dockless bike sharing, where all the tech is crammed into each bike, eliminating the 
need for docking stations. When riders are done, they just park and lock the bike and walk away; the bike 
simply awaits the next user. This makes the systems cheaper (those docks cost a lot), so dockless bikes can be 
rented for as little as a buck an hour.â€œItâ€™s personal mobility for the last mile,â€? as Euwyn Poon, cofounder of 
dockless bike-Â­sharing firm Spin, says.Related StoriesAarian MarshallElectric Bikes Want to Take On Everyone&#8212;Even UberFelix SalmonBring On the BikocalypseErin GriffithWhy Investors 
Are Betting That Bike Sharing Is the Next UberDockless also creates something like self-governing internet logic, with bikes as packets 
routed where theyâ€™re needed, rather than where docks will fit. This seems to make bike sharing more fair: Seattle city 
councilÂ­member Mike Oâ€™Brien has observed anecdotally that dockless bike sharing is used by a broader demographic, in part because itâ€™s 
super cheap and the bikes can circulate outside the well-off downtown neighborhoods.Want even more inventiveness and innovation? Behold the next 
phase arriving in a few years: dockless electric bikes. Batteries are cheaper and lighter than ever. One US firm, Jump 
Bikes, has custom-Â­designed dockless ebikes sprinkled around San Francisco and Washington, DC. CEO Ryan Rzepecki suspects theyâ€™ll eclipse the appeal 
of regular bike sharing, because you could arrive at work without being drenched in sweat. â€œThe number of people who 
are willing to ride electric bikes is probably 10X that of people who are willing to ride a regular one,â€? 
he says.Clearly the bike-share revolution has limits. It probably wonâ€™t work outside urban areas. And if too many bikes flood 
a city, dockless systems can produce chaotic piles of bikes on certain sidewalks and streets, as has happened in China. 
This is a pretty solvable problem, though, if cities decide to limit the number of dockless bikes.So sure, bring on 
the self-driving cars. Dig those hyperloops! But for a world thatâ€™s rapidly urbanizing and heating, the truly cool tech is 
bikes. And bike sharing has oodles of civic benefits too, says Elliot Fishman, director of Australiaâ€™s Institute for Sensible Transport: 
It relieves pressure on public transit, produces vanishingly small emissions compared to cars, and, at least with nonelectric bikes, boosts 
the overall exercise level (duh!).Best of all, the bike-tech revolution reminds us that innovation isnâ€™t always about the totally new. 
Itâ€™s often just as powerful to blend a robust, old tool that works well with a bit of new tech 
to make it better. Sometimes you truly donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel.Write to clive@clivethompson.net.This article appears in the May
