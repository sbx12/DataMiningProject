	Whatâ€™s the shiniest, most exciting new technology for transportation? Well, there are plenty of candidates! Weâ€™ve got the self-Â­driving 
car and drones big enough to carry people. Elon Musk is getting ready to bore hyperloop tunnels. When it comes 
to moving humans around, the future looks to be merging with sci-fi.But from where I stand, the most exciting form 
of transportation technology is more than 100 years oldâ€”and itâ€™s probably sitting in your garage. Itâ€™s the bicycle. The future 
of transportation has two thin wheels and handlebars.Modern tech has transformed the humble two-Â­wheeler, making the bike-share model possible: You 
check out a bike from a docking station, use it for an hour or so, then return to any other 
docking station. The concept was tried back in the â€™60s but failed miserably because no one could track where the 
bikes went.Today, thatâ€™s been solved with smartphone-ized tech: GPS, Bluetooth, RFID, and mobile-payment systems. And bike sharing has unlocked a 
ton of American interest in navigating cities on a bike: Usage has grown from 320,000 rides in 2010 to 28 
million in 2016. In China, where gridlock in cities like Beijing is infamous, the trend has grown even faster.But cooler 
tricks are possible. Weâ€™re now seeing dockless bike sharing, where all the tech is crammed into each bike, eliminating the 
need for docking stations. When riders are done, they just park and lock the bike and walk away; the bike 
simply awaits the next user. This makes the systems cheaper (those docks cost a lot), so dockless bikes can be 
rented for as little as a buck an hour.â€œItâ€™s personal mobility for the last mile,â€? as Euwyn Poon, cofounder of 
dockless bike-Â­sharing firm Spin, says.Related StoriesAarian MarshallElectric Bikes Want to Take On Everyone&#8212;Even UberFelix SalmonBring On the BikocalypseErin GriffithWhy Investors 
Are Betting That Bike Sharing Is the Next UberDockless also creates something like self-governing internet logic, with bikes as packets 
routed where theyâ€™re needed, rather than where docks will fit. This seems to make bike sharing more fair: Seattle city 
councilÂ­member Mike Oâ€™Brien has observed anecdotally that dockless bike sharing is used by a broader demographic, in part because itâ€™s 
super cheap and the bikes can circulate outside the well-off downtown neighborhoods.Want even more inventiveness and innovation? Behold the next 
phase arriving in a few years: dockless electric bikes. Batteries are cheaper and lighter than ever. One US firm, Jump 
Bikes, has custom-Â­designed dockless ebikes sprinkled around San Francisco and Washington, DC. CEO Ryan Rzepecki suspects theyâ€™ll eclipse the appeal 
of regular bike sharing, because you could arrive at work without being drenched in sweat. â€œThe number of people who 
are willing to ride electric bikes is probably 10X that of people who are willing to ride a regular one,â€? 
he says.Clearly the bike-share revolution has limits. It probably wonâ€™t work outside urban areas. And if too many bikes flood 
a city, dockless systems can produce chaotic piles of bikes on certain sidewalks and streets, as has happened in China. 
This is a pretty solvable problem, though, if cities decide to limit the number of dockless bikes.So sure, bring on 
the self-driving cars. Dig those hyperloops! But for a world thatâ€™s rapidly urbanizing and heating, the truly cool tech is 
bikes. And bike sharing has oodles of civic benefits too, says Elliot Fishman, director of Australiaâ€™s Institute for Sensible Transport: 
It relieves pressure on public transit, produces vanishingly small emissions compared to cars, and, at least with nonelectric bikes, boosts 
the overall exercise level (duh!).Best of all, the bike-tech revolution reminds us that innovation isnâ€™t always about the totally new. 
Itâ€™s often just as powerful to blend a robust, old tool that works well with a bit of new tech 
to make it better. Sometimes you truly donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel.Write to clive@clivethompson.net.This article appears in the May

Data: 
	Imagine driving through California, your vehicle packed with Mendocino Countyâ€™s finest kush. That scenario might once have induced a 
panic attack orâ€”depending on your temperamentâ€”an adrenaline spike. Now that medical and adult-use recreational cannabis is legal, itâ€™s a legit 
way to make a paycheck, and hitting the road with a trunk full of the devilâ€™s lettuce is mostly cool.Cool, 
but complicated.Itâ€™s not just that the federal government still considers transporting cannabis very much a crime. Itâ€™s not even that 
California has never finalized rules for moving the leafy greens, even two decades after legalizing medical toking. (Insert joke about 
the duration of an average Phish song here.) It was only in January, a year after Californians voted to legalize 
recreational marijuana, that the state issued temporary regs.These laid the groundwork for a digital track-and-trace system, which will be outlined 
in full once the stateâ€™s weed agency, the Bureau of Cannabis Control, releases the final regulations in the next month 
or so. A crucial part of the system will be licensing every vehicle used to traffic transport weed across the 
state.This has the weed transport industry equal parts excited and anxious. On one hand, legitimate cannabis capitalists using armored vehicles 
will no longer have to compete with that shady dude who swears his Honda CRX can outrun any jackers. On 
the other hand, Californiaâ€™s pre-existing laws require many commercial vehicles operating within the state register with the federal Department of 
Transportationâ€”by telling them exactly how the vehicle will be used.When California first decriminalized marijuana with the 1996 Compassionate Use Act, 
it simply â€œencouraged the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution 
of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana.â€? Over two decades, the state built up structure and oversight 
for the medical cannabis systemâ€”except the whole to-and-from thing. â€œIt was really the wild west in terms of transportation because 
there were zero regulations,â€? says Alison Malsbury, a cannabis industry lawyer with Harris Bricken in San Francisco.The sun began to 
set on Californiaâ€™s cannabis transport free-for-all in November 2016, when voters passed Proposition 64, allowing state-licensed dispensaries to sell cannabis 
and cannabis-infused products to adults age 21 and up. (It also allows grown ups to grow their own crops, give 
small amounts of weed as gifts, and carry up to an ounce without worrying about tripping up the law.)The law 
also came with a requirement that vehicles used to transport cannabis must be owned, or leased, by someone with a 
permit issued by the Bureau of Cannabis Control. For now, those permits are temporary, dictated by an emergency set of 
rules the agency set out in January. This permitting system is integral to digital track-and-trace, the centerpiece of Californiaâ€™s cannabis 
regulation that demands every bit grown and sold in the state is accounted for, from seed to smoke.Each plant gets 
a serial number, as does the bud that it produces, as do all the oils, tinctures, dabs, cookies, candies, lotions, 
extracts, and whatever other products the young industryâ€™s mad alchemists create from the raw material. Anyone transporting the stuff will 
have to scan an RFID tag upon pickup and delivery. Theyâ€™ll have to deliver it in a GPS-equipped vehicle and 
stick to a predetermined route, no unplanned excursions or unscheduled pit stops.Beyond that, the temporary regulations offer little in the 
way of specifics. The transport will be commercial but small scale. Big rigs, or any other vehicle over 10,000 pounds, 
gets regulated by the federal government, so as long as Californiaâ€™s legal cannabis transporters stick to smaller vehicles (think unmarked 
Sprinter vans or armored cars) the feds should turn a blind eye.How am I supposed to tell the feds Iâ€™m 
going to starting up a criminal conspiracy to transport cannabis?But Californiaâ€™s regulations contain at least one glaring oversight that could 
force some would-be cannabis couriers to snitch on themselves. Anyone hoping to commercially transport cannabis in California must apply for 
a Motor Carrier Permit (the only exception is for companies transporting their own goods). The catch is, beginning in 2016, 
the stateâ€™s Department of Transportation began requiring any commercial vehicle seeking a Motor Carrier permit to obtain a federal DOT 
number. That involves explaining to the federalesâ€”who are not so cool with this marijuana thingâ€”exactly how the vehicle will be 
used.â€œHow am I supposed to tell the feds Iâ€™m going to starting up a criminal conspiracy to transport cannabis?â€? says 
Debby Goldsberry, the CEO of Magnolia Wellness, an Oakland cannabis company, who is hoping to add cannabis transport to her 
companyâ€™s roster of services. She might be able to get around this requirement, as long as she is only transporting 
her companyâ€™s own products. But Goldsberry wants to be able to transport anyoneâ€™s goods, so the stateâ€™s limits her potential 
to grow as a business.Unless she wants to start another business altogether. Thereâ€™s another way around the rule: Own a 
preexisting transport company. Or, in the stateâ€™s legal parlance, a licensed motor carrier. For instance, many cannabis transport companies started 
out as traditional armored car services. â€œWe currently have four armored vehicles loaded with product at the moment,â€? says Jeff 
Breier, COO of HardCar Security. His company offers an elite transport, staffed by combat veterans. This overlap in cash and 
cannabis transport is actually pretty beneficialâ€”most weed companies deal in cash, because federal rules bar them from having bank accounts.Technically, 
motor carrier companies are supposed to report what they are shipping when they apply for their federal DOT number. Existing 
transport companies donâ€™t have to worry about this, because they are already registered. However, new transport companies that hope to 
specialize in cannabis will have to get â€¦ creative with their applications. Goldsberry says, sheâ€™d prefer if California just update 
its transportation statute, so it doesnâ€™t require cannabis transport vehicles under 10,000 pounds register with the federal government. â€œWe donâ€™t 
believe in building a business based on violating federal law,â€? she says.For the time being, she is stuck with her 
dilemma. â€œWe canâ€™t change whatâ€™s written in statute with our regulations,â€? says California Bureau of Cannabis Control spokesperson Aaron Francis. 
The stateâ€™s DOT and DMV arenâ€™t likely to make an exception without serious political pressure. Until that happens, cannabis transport 
companies hoping to take the high road better keep things on the low-down.Sticky Icky SituationsCannabis tech is making coffee betterThe

Data: 
	The federal government is finally embracing drones. This week, the FAA endorsed 10 pilot projects that will see UAVs 
delivering medicine, inspecting infrastructure, monitor the border, and more. â€œThis tech is developing so rapidly that our country is reaching 
a tipping point,â€? said Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, when announcing the trials. Depending on the results, the little buzzers 
could become even more common than the mosquitos some of them are being programmed to help eradicate.So itâ€™s natural for 
drone operators to start thinking ahead to the next big leap: carrying people. Uber continued its efforts to cement itself 
at the center of this fledgling industry this week with its two-day Uber Elevate Summit. Nearly 1,000 attendees from academia, 
industry, and government gathered in Los Angelesâ€™ Skirball Cultural Center to discuss how to make flying taxis a reality.Among them 
was the FAA. Unlike the other participants, who were all gung-ho about the possibility of launching passenger-stuffed drones off the 
top of tall buildings, the agency tasked with keeping American skies safe struck a more measured note. While saying that 
it would work on regulations and air traffic control systems, it stressed that compared to smaller drones, the path to 
regulating human flight is likely to be different, harder, and longer.TakeoffUber has made its reputation by being being quick and 
disruptive, often ignoring rules and regulations that would hold it back from deploying its cars. That approach has occasionally backfiredâ€”and 
helped cost founder Travis Kalanick his jobâ€”but it led Uber to a $72 billion valuation.For flying vehicles, that strategy is 
not going to wash. In contrast to state officials eager to bring in high-tech jobs, or city regulators who werenâ€™t 
fast enough to deal with the aggressive not-quite-taxi competition, the FAA has serious power, and at the national level. Uber 
needs the FAA to certify the vehicles its partners are building, and give it permission to operate in the tightly 
controlled airspace that itâ€™s targeting. And the FAA doesnt brook revolution.â€œWeâ€™re the safety regulators, weâ€™re going to come at this 
from safety perspective,â€? said the acting administrator of the FAA, Dan Elwell, in an on-stage conversation with Uberâ€™s head of 
product, Jeff Holden.Lofty ProposalsUber wants to build a network of a new type of vehicle. Using batteries, motors, and multiple 
small propellers for lift, these vertical takeoff and landing aircraft should quieter, cheaper, and easier to fly than helicopters. Uber 
proposes a service that will depart from drone ports set atop tall buildings, flying customers across cities, starting in Los 
Angeles and Dallas Fort-Worth by the end of 2023.Sounds neat. Just donâ€™t expect it too soon. â€œThe pace of technological 
advancement in this industry is faster than anything weâ€™ve had to deal with,â€? Ellwell says. â€œWhen you put passengers on 
autonomous vehicles, as opposed to delivering a package, you introduce a much, much higher bar you need to get over.â€? 
To get past that, Uber is proposing having on-board pilots at first, before eventually making them autonomous (hopefully).LEARN MOREThe WIRED 
Guide to DronesDesigning, building, and certifying a new passenger jet takes a decade and involves years of testing and proving 
to the FAA everythingâ€™s incredibly reliable and safe. Uberâ€™s counting the months until itâ€™s ready to start trials in 2020, 
and it, and its manufacturing partners have only shown prototypes.Elwell says the regulators arenâ€™t going to be able to match 
industry pace, but theyâ€™re going to try. â€œYou have more commitment, top to bottom, to bring these technologies to viable 
life than Iâ€™ve ever seen,â€? says Elwell.Not Quite Cleared for TakeoffThe most telling exchange between Elwell and Uberâ€™s Holden came 
when an audience member asked how air traffic controller might handle an exponential increase in flying machines. Holden described a 
scheme that involves carving out a corridor of airspace over Dallas-Fort Worth, which commercial vehicles would avoid, and within which 
Uber would manage traffic.â€œWhat you just described is where we donâ€™t want to go. You just described segregated airspace,â€? said 
Elwell, jokingly at first, offering to give him a number to try negotiating that with American Airlines. Then he got 
serious. â€œMy hope is that we donâ€™t have to do that.â€? He would rather see an integrated airspace, where everyone 
shares the skies with rules and technology to avoid each other, which he views as a better long-term solution.Holden clarified 
that Uber does see integration as the eventual goal, but separating traffic might be a good first step, to get 
services up and running. The FAA chief wasnâ€™t having it. â€œThe crawling and walking, we try to do it â€˜off 
Broadway,â€™ in places where you can solve the problem without creating too much disruption,â€? he replied. Note that those 10 
drone pilot programs are in places like Reno, Nevadaâ€”not rubbing elbows with the fourth busiest airport in the world.Itâ€™s a 
sobering reminder to Uber and the other enthusiastic companies at the summit that winning over the FAA means proving the 
safety and wisdom of every move they make. Thatâ€™s why Uberâ€™s being extra cooperative. This week, it renewed a partnership 
with NASA to figure out the air traffic issues, and see what effect small passenger aircraft would have on DFWâ€™s 
air traffic at peak times. Here, it has found the one regulator it canâ€™t ignore or steamroll on its way 
to takeoff.More From WIREDBolivia is landlocked, but dont tell its NavyIf Trump really is laundering money, here how it worksBoston

Data: 
	For Donald Trump, there was the purchase of the $12.6 million Scottish estate and the $79.7 million for golf 
courses in the United Kingdom, not to mention the $16.2 million for the Northern Virginia Winery. All in cash.For Michael 
Cohen, it was the lucrative day in 2014 when he sold four Manhattan buildings for $32 millionâ€”three times what heâ€™d 
paid for them less than three years before.Recent days have been filled with a seeming tidal wave of fresh revelations 
from the spiraling investigation around Donald Trumpâ€™s ties to Russia, particularly around suspicious financial transactions involving Trump fixer Michael Cohen, 
who appears to have used the same shell company LLC to pay hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels, collect 
six- and seven-figure consulting deals from companies like AT&amp;T and Novartis, and receive payments from a company with close ties 
to oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.The subtext of many of the recent talesâ€”from Donald Trumpâ€™s massive cash-spending spree to Cohenâ€™s $32 million 
flip of New York real estateâ€”is that the atypical transactions are worthy of greater scrutiny. After all, why was the 
self-proclaimed â€œKing of Debtâ€? suddenly waist-deep in cash and on a spending spree in the midst of the global real 
estate crash? Where was Cohenâ€™s money coming fromâ€”and where was it going?Itâ€™s the old adage from the Watergate investigation: â€œFollow 
the money.â€?The implication, particularly in the more fever-swampy portions of Twitter, is that there was money laundering afootâ€”probably Russian in 
origin. The â€œquidâ€? perhaps, before the election and the â€œpro quoâ€? afterward. But is that a real possibilityâ€”and if it 
was money laundering, by whom and how?The payments appear to mirror suspicious activity that led to the earliest charges and 
investigative avenues of special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s probe, the money laundering and conspiracy charges leveled against former Trump campaign chair 
Paul Manafort and aide Rick Gates. (Gates has since pleaded guilty; Manafortâ€™s case continues to move forward toward trial later 
this year.)But to Treasury officials and law enforcement who have long pursued money laundering and terrorist financing probes, itâ€™s not 
what Donald Trump or Michael Cohen did in any single transaction that raises red flagsâ€”itâ€™s how they conducted business day 
in and day out. The layers of shell companies, the contracts involving pseudonyms, the law firm cut-outs to make deals.Many 
of the activities, when viewed in aggregate, point to a deliberate attempt to create opacity,â€? says Amit Sharma, who used 
to work on countering terrorist financing after 9/11 at the Treasury Department. â€œWhen you take two steps back, you see 
a murkiness and level of complexity with which the Cohen and Trump companies have operatedâ€”what are they hiding? Why are 
secondary and tertiary entities signing under pseudonyms and â€˜cover names? Truly legitimate, transparent companies donâ€™t need to do that. Does 
this point to corruption and/or conspiracy? It certainly looks that way! Are all activities pointing to specific money laundering transactions? 
Not necessarily.â€?The fundamental approach to Trump and Cohenâ€™s empires should raise eyebrowsâ€”and evidently has with Muellerâ€™s probe and prosecutors in 
the Southern District of New Yorkâ€”precisely because of the apparently great lengths they undertook to evade basic transparency. While not 
necessarily illegalâ€”some of the tactics are, in fact, regular parts of complex businessesâ€”the pattern of activity points to an attempt 
to evade one of the basic precepts of modern banking and anti-money-laundering efforts: Know your customer.â€œWhat we call â€˜covered institutions,â€™ 
thatâ€™s any financial institution overseen by US financial regulations, they have to have a comprehensive anti-money-laundering regime. It basically come 
down to one central question: Do you know your customer? Whoâ€™s behind the account, who has control over an entity 
or can facilitate transactions on its behalf, what are its sources of funds, and what is the normal, expected nature 
of its business or pattern of activity for that person or entity? Sharma says. â€œAnytime a bank or financial institution 
spots activity that doesnâ€™t match the regular pattern, theyâ€™re required to file suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department.â€? (Those 
exact type of reports were triggered by odd withdrawals and payments by the Russian embassy around the time of the 
US election, and are the subject of part of Muellerâ€™s probe, according to Buzzfeed.)Yet while regulationsâ€”especially since 9/11â€”require in-depth documentation 
and identification for basic banking for individuals, it has been much easierâ€”until literally todayâ€”for corporate entities to hide their identities 
behind lawyers and shell companies. â€œFinancial institutions are mandated to collect all this data on its customers, but up until 
now, financial institutions have not had to do the same for companies,â€? Sharma says. â€œFor companies, often it has simply 
been the business location and Tax ID number and we donâ€™t know the underlying ownership. We donâ€™t know whether itâ€™s 
a Russian oligarch.â€? (In fact, new Treasury Department rules that require stronger due diligence on banks to understand who actually 
ownsâ€”or has a controlling interest inâ€”a company only come into effect today, May 11, 2018.)As Sharma says, â€œTrump and his 
companies have exercised this practice for many yearsâ€”it seems that every new project, every product, every new building, heâ€™s starting 
a new company or legal entity to manage it. This has been the case for overseas operations and activities as 
well. People do this to protect themselves from liability and to create protective measures that donâ€™t roll directly up to 
them personally. In any given structure, he may own a portion of a parent company that owns a controlling interest 
in a holding company that may own a portion or receive economic benefits of the real estate.â€?In 2016 The Wall 
Street Journal Jean Eaglesham, Mark Maremont, and Lisa Schwartz outlined a specific example of just that sort of structure: â€œDonald 
Trump owns a helicopter in Scotland. To be more precise, he has a revocable trust that owns 99 percent of 
a Delaware limited liability company that owns 99 percent of another Delaware LLC that owns a Scottish limited company that 
owns another Scottish company that owns the 26-year-old Sikorsky S-76B helicopter, emblazoned with a red â€˜TRUMPâ€™ on the side of 
its fuselage.â€? All told, the Journal reported, 15 entities were used at that point to â€œownâ€? Trumpâ€™s fleet of two 
airplanes and three helicopters.Layer on layer of corporate structure makes it hard for investigators, tax officials, or prying lawyers to 
figure out who owns what, the underlying source of money for specific transactions, whether taxes are being appropriately paid in 
a given jurisdiction, or who might be partners in what enterprises.Thatâ€™s where â€œSection 311â€? comes in.In 2001, as part of 
the USA Patriot Act, the Treasury Department was given a new tool against money laundering, known as â€œSection 311,â€? after 
the relevant section of the law, to designate foreign financial institutions, jurisdictions, or entities as â€œof primary money laundering concern.â€?A 
Section 311 designation was meant to help authorities highlight suspicious patterns of activity without having to prove any single transaction 
was illegalâ€”itâ€™s the rough equivalent for money laundering of the criminal RICO statute, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 
that allows prosecutors to take down entire mafia families, drug cartels, and street gangs without having to prove everyone involved 
knew about or participated in all the various individual crimes.â€œWe deliberately put these tools together to go after really bad 
peopleâ€”organized crime, terrorists, dictators, Chinese Triads,â€? Sharma says. â€œYou didnâ€™t have to point to a single illegal transaction. The totality 
of the transactions should give you pause enough that we would want to be sure US institutions scaled back or 
ceased doing business with them.â€?The designation, which effectively forces US financial institutions to sever ties with the entity, makes it 
all but impossible for an entity to participate in the global financial system. In the years since, the US Treasury 
Department has used Section 311 to go after the banks and front companies that help North Korea evade sanctions, to 
go after Iranâ€™s nuclear program and terrorism financing, to isolate Syria, to punish banks that helped Saddam Hussein launder money, 
and to pressure off-shore havens, like the Pacific island of Nauru, that the US believes are complicit in money laundering.Sharma 
says that if what we have seen with Michael Cohenâ€™s business dealings existed anywhere overseas, where it intersected with an 
investigation or a politically exposed person or national security issue of import to the US, it would ring all sorts 
of alarm bells at Treasury. What seems to be continually revealed is a pattern of atypical financial transactions, and too 
much of it seems structured specifically to hide and evade critical information or people involved.That desire for opacity, though, doesnâ€™t 
necessarily point to money laundering. A specific charge of â€œmoney launderingâ€? requires that the initial funds be traced to a 
so-called â€œpredicate,â€? a recognized serious crime. â€œIt could be fraud, smuggling, selling high technology, proceeds of child pornography. There are 
hundreds of predicate crimes in the United States; the global standard is â€˜all serious crimes,â€™â€? explains former Treasury agent John 
Cassara. The complexity of tracing money all the way through the financial system, from a legitimate asset back to a 
crime, or vice versa, makes these cases some of the most challenging investigators undertake. â€œThese are very, very difficult casesâ€”it 
takes a lot for the investigators, the prosecutors, the US attorney to understand,â€? Cassara says.Part of the reason the cases 
are so tough is that there are plenty of other, nonillegal reasons wealthy people create opacity, including to minimize taxes, 
to limit personal or corporate legal liability, or to shield assets in divorce proceedings.The truth of the matter is that 
the global financial system is simply too large for officials to look at very closely.Money laundering is a hugeâ€”literally physically 
hugeâ€”problem: Illicit drug sales in the United States alone are estimated at around $60 billion to $100 billion a year, 
which translates, Cassara says, into about 20 million physical pounds of currency, far too much to be moved easily or 
spent easily. â€œThe bad guys have a logistics issue. They want to try to get into a bank or nonbank 
financial institution, so they can spend it,â€? he says.Globally, the International Monetary Fund estimates that between 2 and 5 percent 
of the worldâ€™s gross domestic product is laundered money from illicit activity. â€œThe number I normally use is the total 
is in the range of $4 trillion to $5 trillion, about the amount of the entire federal government budget,â€? says 
Cassara, who spent 26 years investigating such cases and has written multiple textbooks on anti-money-laundering efforts.Given that scale, the hard 
work of thousands of investigators and tax officials the world over amounts to a drop in the proverbial bucket; authorities 
only seize or charge about 1 percent of suspected money laundering cases. â€œBy any measurement, we do a terrible job 
of enforcing this,â€? Cassara says. â€œI have the utmost respect for my colleagues, but if you just compare the bottom 
line with the results, as [financial crime expert] Raymond Baker used to say, total failure is just a decimal point 
away.â€?That shockingly low level of enforcement helps explain how Manafortâ€™s schemeâ€”which Muellerâ€™s team says involved more than $18 million, funneled 
through entities that included oriental rug shops just a few miles from the Treasury Department itselfâ€”ran undetected and unprosecuted for 
so long.Each year, the Treasury Department fields upward of 18 million pieces of financial intelligence, including more than 2 million 
suspicious activity reports from banks and financial institutionsâ€”far more than it can effectively process. Globally, there are 145 foreign financial 
reporting centers, like the Treasury Departmentâ€™s so-called FINCEN, its intelligence and enforcement unit, which translates into tens of millions more 
reports and warnings. Itâ€™s relatively easy for even large-scale financial crimes to hide in that mountain of evidence. â€œYour inbox 
was always full,â€? Cassara says.Today, Cassara says, money launderers have to be incredibly stupid or incredibly unlucky to be caught. 
â€œSince 9/11, the amount of financial intelligence has grown exponentially, so bad guys are taking steps to evade those efforts,â€? 
Cassara says.But whatâ€™s the point of buying, say, $934,350 in oriental rugs (as Manafort is alleged to have done), or 
buying luxury condos in London (as Russian oligarchs are said to be fond of)? How exactly do money laundering schemes 
work?While itâ€™s easier to grasp how to hide cash at the street levelâ€”like in Breaking Bad, when Walter White purchases 
a cash-intensive car wash and simply cooks the book to show heâ€™s washing more cars than he isâ€”money laundering at 
the global level follows the same three-step process:Step 1: PlacementThe first challenge is simply getting the money somewhere into the 
global financial system, which is often easier said than done. Banks are required to file reports anytime someone deposits more 
than $10,000 in cash, so sneaking large amounts of cash into the financial system can pose a huge challenge. Breaking 
large transactions into smaller ones, say multiple deposits of $9,999, to evade the transaction reports is known as â€œstructuringâ€? or 
â€œsmurfing,â€? and is illegal itself. Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert spent time in prison for â€œstructuring,â€? as part 
of his effort to pay hush money to one of the men he sexually abused as a high school coach, 
rather than for the underlying abuse. â€œPlacement is where criminals are most vulnerable, because the money is closest to the 
original crime,â€? Cassara says. â€œItâ€™s much easier to catch them at the crime than to say â€˜thereâ€™s a suspicious shopping 
center or golf courseâ€™ and work backwards.â€?Tracing â€œlaunderedâ€? money back to illicit proceeds is key to any investigation.Step 2: LayeringThe 
second challenge is hiding the origin of the illicit money. Thatâ€™s where the layers of LLCs can be helpful. Every 
time money movesâ€”from one entityâ€™s account to another, from one bank to another, from one country to anotherâ€”it helps hide 
the original source. â€œItâ€™s confusing and makes it difficult for investigators, tax officials, or a former wife to follow that 
money trail. Itâ€™s using this labyrinth of LLCs and tax havens, in the US and overseas, to make it difficult 
and time-consuming to trace,â€? Cassara says. â€œIt gets hard because of issues of [investigative] competence, venue, jurisdiction.â€?Often, this â€œlayeringâ€? step 
takes place with the help of lawyers and law firms; the revelations of the Panama Papers and the follow-on Paradise 
Papers laid out just how large a global business it is to help elites hide their assets. â€œMany of these 
folks have go-to structures and lawyers they use to go through the layering process,â€? Sharma says. â€œA lot of laundering 
happens through nonfinancial businesses and professions.â€¦The Russians use a ton of folks in Turkey, UAE, and Cyprus. That fact pattern 
is well-known and long-standing.â€?While the Panama and Paradise Papers revelations focused primarily on overseas entities and tax havens, the United 
States is actually one of the worst global offenders: The so-called â€œDelaware companyâ€? structure is notorious for its lax documentation 
and opacity, as NPRâ€™s Planet Money found out when they set up shell companies in Belize and Delaware in 2012.Step 
3: IntegrationOnce the money is in the global financial system and its origins properly obfuscated, the final challenge is making 
the money accessibleâ€”that is, integrating it into the legitimate economy. At the high end of money laundering, this often means 
purchasing real estate.â€œReal estate is a big issue for money laundering and has been for a long time,â€? Cassara says. 
â€œIf youâ€™ve got a condo or a shopping center or a golf course, the money has already been placed, itâ€™s 
already been layered, itâ€™s the final stageâ€”integrated. The authorities arenâ€™t going to look at that. Once you see property, in 
whatever form it is, itâ€™s assumed thatâ€™s good, thatâ€™s a legitimate investment.â€?Large-scale money laundering, like what corrupt regimes or oligarchs 
need, requiresâ€”like any good investment portfolioâ€”a well-balanced portfolio. â€œIf youâ€™ve got that much money, you need diversification,â€? Cassara says. â€œYouâ€™re 
going to put so much into gold, so much into stocks, so much into golf courses. By that point, theyâ€™re 
many steps away from illicit proceeds.â€?Real estate is particularly attractive for money laundering because of the large numbers involvedâ€”a single 
large transaction to purchase a golf course, a luxury condo, or shopping center is an easy way to make a 
whole lot of money look legitimate at once without raising any eyebrows with banks or regulators. Itâ€™s also a good 
way to evade so-called â€œcapital controls,â€? which limit, for instance, the amount of money Chinese citizens can transfer out of 
the country.The goal in such efforts isnâ€™t necessarily to have access to immediate cashâ€”sometimes the end goal is simply to 
own a physical asset. â€œParkingâ€? illicit gains from corrupt regimes, including Russia or China, in luxury real estate in the 
West is a common pattern because it historically holds value and, if youâ€™re the buyer, you only trigger taxes by 
selling, not with the initial transaction. â€œReal estate tends to hold its value, luxury real estate typically even goes upâ€”itâ€™s 
a great way to preserve it without losing it,â€? Sharma says.Such absentee ownersâ€”more interested in parking their assets than actually 
occupying a residenceâ€”has led to the phenomenon of what locals call â€œlights out London,â€? entire luxury buildings or wealthy neighborhoods 
where hardly anyone is ever home. More than 85,000 offshore shell companies own British real estate, and one report last 
year found nearly $6 billion worth of properties owned by politicians and public officials with â€œsuspicious wealth.â€?Similar concerns have been 
raised about Libyan purchases in Dubai, Chinese purchases in Vancouver, and Russian purchases in Miami, among other cities. Itâ€™s such 
a problem in New York real estate that the Treasury Department is moving to end anonymous all-cash purchases.And then thereâ€™s 
the oriental rugs. Perhaps the oddest part of the lengthy, detailed indictment of Paul Manafort is the nearly $1 million 
he evidently funneled through various antique rug shops. As Adam Davidson wrote at The New Yorker last fall, â€œItâ€™s hard 
to imagine a person who spends $12 million over six years but only shops at a handful of stores, and 
nearly always happens to have a bill that ends in multiple zeroes: $107,000, then $20,000, then $250,000. At an unnamed 
menâ€™s-clothing store in New York, Manafort spent $32,000, $15,000, $24,000, and other multiples of a thousand. For money-laundering experts, this 
fact alone would be cause for suspicion. It is extremely rare for even a single purchase to end in three 
zeroes.â€?The rugs and clothing appear to be an example of what officials call â€œtrade-based money laundering,â€? using physical goods to 
evade currency reporting limits. There are, after all, only three ways to move money around the globe: Through bank transfers, 
through cash, or through physical trade. â€œI argue that trade-based money laundering is actually the largest of the three money 
laundering ideologies but itâ€™s the one weâ€™ve done the least to enforce,â€? Cassara says. â€œWhen a buyer and a seller 
are working together, the price of an object can be whatever they want it to beâ€”it could be pens, it 
could be gold, it could be carpetsâ€¦.The reason itâ€™s so effective is that global merchant transactions is in the tens 
of millions of dollars [a day]. Try to find the suspect transaction in that sea.â€?Itâ€™s relatively easy for a determined 
money launderer to falsify invoices, either inflating or deflating price, with the willing cooperation of a commercial partnerâ€”like an oriental 
rug store, where you purchase a rug thatâ€™s worth $5,000 for, say, $20,000 and the store owner returns the difference 
to you in cash. Or buy a rug worth $20,000, and buy it from Shop A for $5,000 and sell 
it to Shop B for the full priceâ€”the difference becomes all clean money. â€œI sold those rugs to another shop, 
that cash from Shop B, paid to me, is effectively washed,â€? Sharma explains.That so many of the transactions and behaviors 
of the Trump business empire and Michael Cohenâ€™s empire appear to hew so closely to the well-known patterns and stages 
of money laundering deeply troubles Sharma.â€œIt falls into fact patterns that weâ€™ve seen in other areas of Russian and Eastern 
European organized crime,â€? he says. â€œWeâ€™re staring at a governmentâ€”that goes right to the topâ€”that engages in very way of 
doing business and the exact same fact patterns that we set these tools up to combat. Thatâ€™s mind-boggling to me.â€?More

Data: 
	Itâ€™s been a hell of a two days for Boston Dynamicsâ€™ fantastical quadruped robot SpotMini. Yesterday, it starred in 
a new video that may seem, well, a bit ho-hum at first glanceâ€”at least compared to the companyâ€™s other recent 
reveals. The robot doesnâ€™t open doors for its friends or fight off a human assailant brandishing a hockey stick. It 
simply traipses down corridors, through doorways, and up a staircase. Yet within that short journey lies a tantalizing detail about 
SpotMini the robot dog.Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert followed that up today at the TechCrunch Sessions: Robotics conference at UC 
Berkeley with surprising news for the secretive company: SpotMini is coming to market, and soon. The company is planning to 
build 100 units later this year.â€œThat the prelude to getting them into a higher rate production,â€? Raibert said on stage, 
â€œwhich we hope to start about the middle of next year.â€? He declined to disclose the price, but did say 
the machine in the most recent video is about 10 times cheaper to produce than a previous iteration. â€œAnd we 
think we can go further,â€? Raibert said.Boston Dynamics has long been research-focused, but that doesnâ€™t mean it hasnâ€™t been thinking 
about what consumers want out of SpotMini. For one, buyers will be able to mount their own hardware on SpotMiniâ€™s 
back, Raibert said. Boston Dynamics is also working on its own add-on packages. â€œFor instance, we have a surveillance package 
where we have special cameras that can mount on the back,â€? he said. And that famous arm that helped the 
robot open the door for its friend? Thatâ€™s an extra option thatâ€™ll be removable.Notably, the new video helps explain how 
Boston Dynamics is getting SpotMini to operate autonomously. According to the videoâ€™s description, an operator first manually drives the robot 
around its surroundings, as the machine captures the view with cameras on its sides and front and back. Then when 
SpotMini is unleashed to walk the same route on its own, it uses that captured visual data to get its 
bearings. Self-driving car companies get their machines rolling in much the same way. First, they map routes with lidar, which 
sprays the road and trees and such with lasers to build a 3-D model of the world. That helps give 
the robocar a better understanding of its surroundings. The difference with SpotMini, though, is that itâ€™s using stereo cameras instead. 
Itâ€™s devoid of the lidar essential to so many robots, Boston Dynamics confirms.Take a look at the 1:00 mark in 
the video above. That â€œObstacle Avoidance Dataâ€? panel at lower left? â€œThat looks like an occupancy grid from a stereo 
point cloud,â€? says Kevin Peterson, cofounder and software lead of Marble, which makes autonomous delivery robots. â€œA stereo point cloud 
is you have two cameras next to each other, like your eyes.â€? Thus, stereo vision.That could give the robot more 
visual resolution than a lidar system. Lidar is better for some things; its range is greater, and it works better 
in bright conditions than an optical camera. But â€œwhat interesting here is they are going indoors and outdoors on a 
reasonably bright day,â€? says Peterson, â€œso that means their stereo system is working in pretty bright conditions.â€?SpotMiniâ€™s predecessor, Spot, was 
indeed equipped with lidar, but it would make sense for this smaller iteration to ditch lidar in favor of stereo 
cameras. â€œOn a vehicle that small lidar is challenging, it extra weight and it extra power,â€? says Peterson. â€œIt just 
volume that you would rather not take up.â€?So SpotMini is destined to see the world more like we do (unless 
humans start firing lasers out of their eyeballs). And other robotics outfits are exploring ways to get advanced robots to 
navigate our world with cameras alone. Itâ€™s a more energetically efficient way, both in terms of power consumption and bulk, 
to have increasingly advanced robots make their way around.â€œWhat I take away form this is theyre really trying to perfect 
how they walk through the world,â€? says Peterson, â€œand in order to do that they need to understand something about 
the world.â€?And that seems to be working. Boston Dynamics is real close to pushing SpotMini into the real world, only 
this time without using hockey sticks.Bananas BotsNot to throw shade, but SpotMini has some competition for most impressive robotic feat. 
Just a few months ago, Boston Dynamics released this video of its two-legged Atlas robot doing ... wait for it 
... a backflip.Before that, the best it could do was bounce back after a solid kick from a mean-spirited human.Guys, 
just in case it not clear: Please dont kick the robots. Related VideoScienceTo Make Better Robots, You Gotta Crash Tiny

Data: 
	Transportation is a world full of visionaries: big ideas gone even bigger. It attracts world shakers (and breakers) like 
Grimesâ€™ Boyfriend, Travis Kalanick, and Mark Moore, a 30-year NASA veteran who decamped last year for Uberâ€™s new flying car 
project. There are lots of fanciful renderings and prototypes, lots of pulled-off covers and pointing of spotlights. But thereâ€™s a 
lot of busted dreams too. Plans that run out of money, petering out and puttering toward death. Collectors who come 
calling. Cars that crash and kill.Which is all to say: It was a mixed bag of a week. Senior writer 
Jack Stewart covered the two-day bonanza that was Uberâ€™s second-annual, and completely serious, flying car summit. Editor Alex Davies took 
a close look at startup Drive.aiâ€™s upcoming self-driving shuttle launch in unlikely Frisco, Texas. Fun stuff! But ugly stuff too: 
Teslaâ€™s investor insurrection, thanks (in part) to Grimesâ€™ Boyfriendâ€™s indelicate earnings call comments. A Waymo crash in Arizona that doesnâ€™t 
appear to have anything to do with self-driving tech but had really unfortunate timing anyway. And a jump in pedestrian 
deathsâ€”which weâ€™ll need much more than autonomous vehicles to prevent.Letâ€™s get you caught up.HeadlinesStories you might have missed from WIRED 
this weekUber wants to play middleman in the flying car future, slinging app-ordered rides that take riders smoothly from A 
to B as the fools in ground-bound vehicles sit in traffic below. But that doesnâ€™t mean it wonâ€™t have a 
hand in the flying car design. This week, the ride-hailing giant turned transportation-everything unveiled an all-electric VTOL concept, and reiterated 
its commitment to an ambitious timeline: commercial flights by 2022.Last weekâ€™s Tesla fireworks continue, with an activist investor now pushing 
the electric carmakerâ€™s shareholders to banish three of its nine board members in favor of folks with relevant manufacturing expertise. 
One way Grimesâ€™ Boyfriend could kill the insurrection? By making more cars.In more Tesla news: The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration clarified that the carmaker, and not the federal agency, came up with a much-cited Autopilot safety statistic. Which meant 
it was a good time for me to ask: How much do we know about Autopilot safety record, anyway?Late last 
week, a Waymo minivan being driven by a human got seriously banged up by an out-of-control Honda driver. Police in 
Chandler, Arizona, determined the Waymo vehicle wasnâ€™t at fault, but the scary photos of the banged-up Chrysler Pacifica were spookily 
reminiscent of this springâ€™s fatal Uber crash.Yeehaw! Alex explores Drive.aiâ€™s plans to launch a self-driving shuttle service in the Lone 
Star State, and why geofenced and limited shuttle routes just might be lots of Americansâ€™ first experiences with autonomous vehicles.Heck 
naw! Contributor Nick Stockton tries to get to the bottom of why Nashville, Tennessee, voters soundly rejected an ambitious transit 
revamp meant to improve transportation in the traffic-choked city.The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released a disturbing study on pedestrian 
deaths, finding fatalities jumped by 46 percent between 2009 and 2016. Some say autonomous vehicles will solve all our road 
safety problems, but the tech has a ways to go. I explore another option: getting much smarter about road design.

Data: 
	No, youâ€™re not imagining things. The timelines for autonomous vehicles keep shifting. Electric carmaker Tesla began selling a $3,000 
â€œfull self-drivingâ€? add-on to its Autopilot feature in 2016â€”everything you need to drive without driving!â€”but still hasnâ€™t turned it on. 
In 2012, Googleâ€™s Sergey Brin said â€œordinary peopleâ€? would have access to self-driving cars by 2017; the company is still 
gearing up for a very limited driverless taxi service this year. Volvo quietly delayed a project that was supposed to 
put 100 Swedish families into autonomous vehicles by 2017.No one wants unready tech on public roads, but for anyone who 
has bought into the technologyâ€™s promise to save lives, the delay is a bummer. To put it very lightly. Almost 
40,000 Americans died on the road last year. And a new study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety finds 
ugly driving trends have hit one group particularly hard: pedestrians. Nearly 6,000 pedestrian died in 2016, a 46 percent jump 
over 2009. And if robots wonâ€™t save the bipeds, who will?Your friendly carbon-based neighborhood traffic engineer canâ€”and they donâ€™t even 
need artificial intelligence or $75,000 laser sensors to do it.â€œIf there is too much emphasis on autonomous vehicles solving the 
problem, when widespread deployability is decades in the future and not next year, I think it increases the temptation to 
hope that the technology is going to save us,â€? says Liisa Ecola, a transportation planner and senior policy analyst with 
the Rand Corporation. â€œTraffic safety is a big problem now and to ignore the things we can do, I think, 
is a disservice to the tens of thousands of people who are killed every year in crashes.â€?So forget robots. Engineers 
and the public officials who dole out their paychecks can start redesigning streets to make them safer. They can zoom 
in on their problem areasâ€”is there a section of road where people keep getting hurt?â€”and start fixing roads today.The IIHS 
study points to the walking pain points, the issues to be solved. Between 2009 and 2016, deaths on arterialsâ€”the high-capacity, 
wide, multilane roads that feed into freeways or highwaysâ€”jumped 67 percent. Deaths at sections of roads that werenâ€™t intersections went 
up 50 percent. Deaths in the dark rose by more than half.The good news is that road engineers have access 
to a suite of â€œtraffic-calmingâ€? measures, which would slow down cars on otherwise fast-paced roads and could prevent many crashes. 
In fact, Scandinavian-inspired Vision Zero programs, which seek to totally eliminate road deaths and have been adopted by hundreds of 
places in the US, lay out basic principles for preventing deaths.Letâ€™s take a particular example of a terrible and tragic 
road death. In March, Arizona resident Elaine Herzberg died when she was struck by a self-driving Uber on a wide, 
multilane road in Tempe, Arizona. The crash made clear the fallibility not just of robotsâ€”we dont know why the Uber 
didnâ€™t hit the brakes or swerveâ€”but of humans. The Uber employee sitting behind the wheel, charged with grabbing the wheel 
to prevent crashes, was looking away from the road when the SUV hit Herzberg.A better robot could have saved Herzbergâ€™s 
life, but so might have better road design. Tempe is pretty typical for a middling-density place. Engineers built its arterials 
to transport cars, and quickly. Their long, straight lines are easy for drivers to navigate but induce a slow, lazy 
â€œzoning out,â€? and a level of comfort that makes it easier to glance away from the road.Deaths like Herzebergâ€™s, on 
streets like Tempeâ€™s, might have been prevented with more frequent and shorter crosswalks. Herzberg, wheeling a bicycle weighed down with 
plastic bags, was about 100 yards from the nearest crosswalk when she died. Thatâ€™s not too far, but given how 
many crosswalks on urban arterials are miles away from each other, itâ€™s not hard to comprehend why a walker like 
Herzberg might risk a run across the road.Another option is to put a street on what engineers call a â€œroad 
diet,â€? narrowing or even eliminating lanes of traffic. Reducing the margin of error makes drivers more likely to pay attentionâ€”research 
evaluated by the Federal Highway Administration suggests road diets can cut crashes by more than 30 percent, and pedestrian deaths 
or injuries by more than 20.Safety-minded engineers suggest that even simply adding trees or landscaping to the sides of roads 
adds eye-catching elements that can force drivers to focus. Things like â€œbulb outs,â€? which jut into the street at intersections 
and shorten distances between corners for pedestrians, work too. Any way engineers can get drivers to slow the heck down 
is helpful. The faster a car is moving, the more likely it is to kill someone in a collision. Youâ€™re 
as much as 5.5 times more likely to kill someone hitting them at 40 mph than 30 mph.(Oh, and drive 
smaller cars too. The IIHS study notes a spike in deaths among those hit by the larger trucks and SUVs 
Americans cannot stop buying.)Implementing these fixes should be far easier than teaching a robot to interpret a traffic copâ€™s hand 
signals. Most transportation engineers now joining the workforce should be well-acquainted with these strategies, and ready to emphasize safety over 
speed. And compared to the economic impact of crashesâ€”not to mention the loss of livesâ€”Vision Zeroâ€“type interventions cost pennies.But thatâ€™s 
not always the way it turns out in city hall. Infrastructure funding is scarce. Drivers can get hostile when you 
suggest slowing their commutes for the sake of, well, anything. And scientists are still struggling to pin rising pedestrian deaths 
on any one factor. â€œTraffic safety is really a very multidisciplinary problem,â€? says Ecola. â€œItâ€™s not something we can fix 
just with engineering solutions or just with campaigns to get people to wear their seatbelts more often. Itâ€™s all of 
those things.â€?Still, if tragic crashes donâ€™t get politiciansâ€™ attention, what will? Hopefully not just the robo-cars that always seem a 
horizon away.On the Road AgainUber makes peace with cities by spilling its secretsWhy traffic-choked Nashville said nope to public transitA

Data: 
	How much do workers at tech firms make?The answer varies a lot, depending on the employer. The median employee 
at Amazon made $28,446 last year, according to new disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. At Facebook, the 
median employee made $240,430, more than eight times as much.There are reasons for the big disparity, of course: Facebookâ€™s 25,000 
employees include many software engineers, which it must recruit in the expensive and competitive San Francisco Bay Area. Most of 
Amazonâ€™s 566,000 employees work in its distribution centers, including many overseas; in the US, Amazon says the average hourly wage 
in its distribution centers is more than $15 an hour, which translates to slightly more than $30,000 a year, before 
overtime.Other disparities reflect differences in companiesâ€™ businesses, and business models. As a car maker, Tesla says 26 percent of its 
employees are production workers and 18 percent are outside the US. The company reported median employee pay of $54,816. Tesla 
says its employees also have benefited from increases in the companyâ€™s share price. IBM, which has aggressively moved jobs overseas 
in recent years, reported median pay of $54,491. The New York Times reported in September that IBM now has more 
employees in India than in the US. An IBM spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Even within the same 
tech sector, median pay can vary significantly based on a companyâ€™s business model. Intel, the largest US maker of semiconductors 
by revenue, makes its own chips. Three of its six manufacturing sites are in the US, as are half of 
its 102,000 employees. The company reported median pay of $102,100. Nvidia, whose graphics chips are used widely for machine learning 
and artificial intelligence, reported median pay of $147,640. The company contracts out the manufacturing of its chips and has only 
about 8,200 employees. A spokesperson says half of Nvidiaâ€™s employees are in the â€œhighly competitiveâ€? Silicon Valley market and that 
its employees are â€œhighly skilled, college educated, and have deep expertiseâ€“all of which command a premium in the market.â€?The median 
pay figures underscore that intense competition for tech talent in the Bay Area. Nationally, the average pay for software developers 
and programmers is $102,470, according to the US Labor Department. Bay Area tech firms are paying considerably more: The median 
pay at Workday, which makes software that helps businesses manage finances and people, is $178,903, according to its proxy statement. 
At Salesforce, another business-software maker, itâ€™s $155,284; and at payments processor Square, itâ€™s $152,265.Companies are disclosing the median pay of 
employees for the first time this year under a new SEC rule intended to shine a light on the high 
pay of CEOs. The rule took effect for fiscal years ending December 31, 2017, or later, so companies on different 
fiscal calendars, including Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, wonâ€™t report their median-pay figures until later this year.Companies have to report the 
ratio of the pay of their CEOs to the median pay of their employees. The Wall Street Journal reported that 
Marathon Petroleum CEO Gary Heminger was paid $19.7 million last year, or 935 times the $21,034 salary of the companyâ€™s 
median worker.The ratios are less meaningful for big tech companies because many of their CEOs are founders who own large 
chunks of the company and receive only nominal compensation. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey received no compensation, according to the companyâ€™s 
proxy statement. Facebookâ€™s Mark Zuckerberg and Google parent Alphabetâ€™s Larry Page each were paid $1. Zuckerbergâ€™s reported compensation also included 
$8.8 million for company-provided security services and travel on company planes. Amazonâ€™s Jeff Bezos was paid a salary of $81,840, 
as he has been annually since 1998; his compensation included $1.6 million for security services paid by the company.Money, Money,

Data: 
	For a company working its way into an industry that specializes in annihilating newcomers, Tesla has proven remarkably persistent. 
It has dodged bankruptcy, built an enormous fan base, and rolled out a series of terrific automobiles that made electric 
cars cool. But the secret to the companyâ€™s endurance is that someone up there likes itâ€”up there being top floor 
corner offices occupied by the investors who have kept Tesla running through 15 profitless years.Now that Tesla is facing a 
series of crisesâ€”a variety of lawsuits, interrogations over the safety of its Autopilot feature, and, most of all, lagging Model 
3 productionâ€”some of those up on high are revealing themselves as Old Testamentâ€“style gods: displeased with what they see happening 
on the ground, and ready to smite.This morning, an activist investor published a letter calling for Tesla shareholders to kick 
three of its nine board members off the board and replace them with people with more relevant experience who will 
be less likely to defer to defiant demigod CEO Elon Musk.The problem is the reality is starting to stack up, 
and thatâ€™s a reality of accidents the cars have had, quality issues, and massive misses on Model 3 production numbers,â€? 
writes that investor, Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW investment group. â€œYou add all that up and thereâ€™s a 
real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.Now that Tesla is mass producing cars, running an energy 
business, and has some 40,000 employees, Waizenegger says it needs board members with experience in manufacturing, utilities, and management, and 
whoâ€™ll be willing to help Musk through various hiccups. â€œThey need to change the composition of the board to reflect 
the evolving business strategy,â€? he says. Tesla expanded its board last year, adding 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch and 
Johnson Publishing Company CEO Linda Johnson Riceâ€”hardly the expertise Waizenegger hoped for, he says. â€œWe needed to do something more 
dramatic.â€?Muskâ€™s refusal to answer analyst queries about Model 3 orders and capital requirements during an investor call last month (he 
dismissed them as â€œboring, bonehead questionsâ€?) didnâ€™t assuage any concerns. â€œWe want the company to survive,â€? Waizenegger says. â€œIt is 
therefore concerning if youâ€™re not able to have a serious conversation with analysts.â€?So, at Teslaâ€™s annual meeting on June 5, 
CtW wants its fellow shareholders to vote against the reelection to the board of venture capitalist Antonio Gracias, Elonâ€™s brother 
Kimbal Musk, and Murdoch. (Like in the Senate, only third of Tesla board members come up for reelection at a 
time.) Itâ€™s another way of saying: Musk should keep the top spot, but he needs more oversight. Tesla declined to 
comment.Waizenegger has long voiced his concerns about Teslaâ€™s board, which has hardly changed since the company went public in 2010, 
and most of whose members have close personal ties to Musk.CtW may be right, but that doesnâ€™t make it mighty. 
And volubility does not mean anybody will join the cause. The firm, which runs pension funds sponsored by Change to 
Win, a federation of unions, holds about 260,000 Tesla shares. By comparison, the automakerâ€™s largest shareholder, Fidelity, holds more than 
16 million. And despite Muskâ€™s concerning performance on that investor call, Tesla seems to be headed in the right direction, 
saying it should hit its target of building 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week in the next few months, and 
reach profitability soon after. Just the sort of thing that should soothe anxious investors.â€œIâ€™m betting almost all of these problems 
would be fine if Model 3 production went to 5,000 plus, starting relatively soon,â€? says Karl Brauer, an auto industry 
analyst with Kelley Blue Book. â€œYou can point to plenty of automakers that have had plenty of controversial issues crop 
up. But if theyâ€™re overall profitable, people rightly assume theyâ€™ll get through it.â€?Waizenegger maintains that experienced board members willing to 
help Musk manage the company are crucial to Teslaâ€™s future. The automaker is in a particularly tough spot right now, 
fighting a series of crises as it tries to roll out the Model 3, the car thatâ€™s supposed to bring 
electric driving to the masses and profits to investors. So the doubters may be more numerous and audible than usual. 
But if Musk has proven anything, itâ€™s that he can sell people on a vision and deliverâ€”even if it takes 
a Hail Mary.All About ElonTesla favorite Autopilot safety stat just doesnt stand upMusk ire reveals a Wall Street-Silicon Valley divideTesla
